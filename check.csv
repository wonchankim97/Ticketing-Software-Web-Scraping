We integrated it in our website and since then have been using it daily.

As we are an events company, we needed a software that could easily help us manage our event ticketing and explara has been a good choice.

When we started events in Singapore last year, we were not sure how to go about with the ticketing.

But with the Explara team's support and guidance, we were able to manage that smoothly.","There are many good things about this software. But certain things need a little improvement.

1. The payout invoices we receive need to be more detailed. Since we are only 2 people managing all the events, it gets difficult to visit the dashboard each time to check the payout for each event.

If along with payout structure that we receive, we would get information about what event tickets we have received a payout for, it will be very helpful.

2. The formatting of the event description can be made better.",,,

First, let's look at listing events. You can upload one picture and Spingo crops it two different ways. There is a tool that is supposed to let you show Spingo which part of the picture to focus on, but it does not work at all. Pictures are often cropped strangely or there is spaced left above and below the picture. I'd really like to be able to upload multiple versions of our creative. Also, every time I list an event I have to reenter my information. You aren't able to store it in your profile. Any time you need to edit an event, you have to submit a request. It takes a day or two for the revisions to be made, and sometimes they aren't exactly what you asked for, so you have to ask again. Sometimes the site gets pretty buggy, too. I click edit event and I get taken to the promotion page. I click view event and I get taken to the promotion page. I see old versions of events that were supposed to have been edited or events that I deleted in my account.","Saves an incredible amount of time, opens up a whole world of reporting capabilities, comparisons to previous years, manage vendors, volunteers, allows to monitor sales and gives better control of our event data and statistics.",,

With integrated ticketing and donor services we now know much more about our patrons, how best to reach them, and what they respond to. The result is higher ticket sales, larger and more frequent donations, and generally stronger support of our little theatre. That the software integrates seamlessly with our website and products like Mailchimp and Facebook is a big plus. The help desk is full of articles which are clear and videos which give step by step instructions for the visual learners among us. But the strength of AP is it's people. Every person I have had contact with is a theatre artist. Because of that they really get my organization, why things I think are critical really are (so nice not to have to convince people of what is important!), and how to best solve whatever problem I am having. Recently they have been expanding their marketing tools. I know that there are many more benefits awaiting my organization if I fully utilize the products that Arts People offer.

As a small and growing company, we struggled for years with providing our audiences with a high quality, accessible and easy to use ticketing systems. Ticket Turtle is not only user friendly from the purchasers perspective, it is also incredibly easy to use as an administrator. There are dozens of reports that give you an up to the minute view of all aspects of your ticket sales, detailed database forms to track your audiences, a very flexible donations and contributions system that makes getting donations from patrons a breeze (not to mention generating automatic thank you emails the instant the donation is received) and a versitile ticket pricing system. We will never use another ticketing system, particularly given the incredible level of customer service we have consistently received. We. Love. Ticket. Turtle.","The only issue we have ever encountered is with the contributions system where it is difficult to process multiple purchased types in a single transaction (ie...buy a ticket, buy season tickets and make a donation all in one transaction). I believe, however, that TT is addressing this for a future version. I would also love to have the option of having TT staff act as ticket sales/phone staff and hope that TT goes down that road to provide that service in the future.",We love this system and will never use another ticketing system.,,

We had finalized on three vendors, a large high-end full featured system focused on commercial theatres, a local, newer fully Canadian system, and Arts-People which had been recommended to us. All of the features of the high-end system at half the cost and with fees in Canadian dollars, we saved currently wicked exchange rates. With over 800 clients, primarily in the United States and Canada, and over ten years development, the system is sophisticated, full bodied, and comprehensive for real-time, online ticket and subscription sales, while being simple enough to be fully DIY, Do It Yourself, user enabled. The range of payment features include PayPal which customers really appreciate. The system is extremely well documented with in-depth, easy to navigate help resources, user forum, and 24/7 expertise. The real joy however is the staff, a close knit, thespian loving group of experts, truly arts people, ready, willing, and able to make you a success. And that's what it's all about, isn't it! Being a Success!! As we develop our own sophistication in marketing, fundraising, and patron management and satisfaction, Arts-People will be with us every step of the way, providing long-term, ever expanding solutions.

We use SyAM for asset management , one benefit is that is has taken away the task of touching each machine to grab the mac address for MAC authentication. We just run a report and grab it from the SyAM asset management application. It also helps us with our yearly inventory report that needs to be presented to the BOE.

We use SyAM for our MDM - by using SyAM we touch the machines once when they come in and then we never see them again unless the screen breaks.

We use SyAM for our ticketing system. We had a reduction in staff this year and the ticketing system has been amazing. When a ticket is created - it is sent out to the techs and they are able to respond in a reasonable time, making everyone happy. I am so glad we have this system.

It has been relatively easy to upgrade our software/database version following the very useful documentation found on the Tessitura Network website. The TN website also features webinars, a community forum, and is packed full of information on upcoming networking events.

Tessitura also offer a Tessitura Network Express Web (TNEW) website solution for online bookings which integrates well with the Tessitura software.","Although the software itself is very customisable with custom plugins and such, it can cause headaches when upgrading to newer versions and has the potential to cause issues - these customisations must be backed up, checked for compatibility, etc. Technical support has originally been handled by agents in the US which had the potential to cause issues with time zones with our organisation being based in the UK, however they have recently restructured their support for Europe and have implemented a new helpdesk system which have helped improve this situation greatly. There are a lot of functions and features that I still feel I've barely touched on as an administrator, as well as there being a steep learning curve for end-users due to the sheer number of features available.

It's confusing, user abusive and extraordinarily expensive. In our town, NPO's had to group together, in one building, where they created a new company that specializes in Tessitura software management.

However, all organizations can see who has who in their database. You can't go into the account, but it becomes readily apparent our prospects and donors are being hit on all the time by all the same organizations. It's tricky. But the fact remains. Tessitura is enormously complex, just to get acknowledgements out is a lot of busy work. When I came on board, the previous development person really used Tessitura as a storage unit and did all the fund raising in Excel and Word.

The learning curve is very steep, which complicates the hiring process for temporary employees (cause they never get to the point of mastery and efficiency with the software), and there is no way to edit out which functions to ""see"" on your screen. For example, if xyz theater never uses a third of the functions of the software, there should be a way to visually hide them so that employees dont get confused about what they are seeing on the screen.

2) When it comes to entering information for credit card payments, the software designers never apparently thought about how the average patron reads out their information over the phone. You have to select the type of card used before entering the card number, meanwhile the patron is halfway through spewing out their number over the phone while the ticketing office employee is scrambling to write it down on a pad of paper cause Tessie wont let them enter the number yet.

271,sro4,SRO4 saved us!,Alex C. D.,Box Office Manager,,,,Capterra,2015-10-16,4,4.0,,5.0,,,"In retrospect, I'm still unclear how we were able to function with our old ticketing system. It wasn't until we officially launched SRO4 as our new and improved ticketing system that we became aware of how horrifyingly lacking our previous system was. It's like realizing you accidentally dodged a lethal bullet by virtue of stopping to tighten an unruly shoelace. SRO4 is essentially the shoelace that saved our lives.

I've used numerous different systems during my thirteen years ticketing performing arts organizations, and SRO4 holds its own when compared to some of the bigger names out there. Compared to our previous system, SRO4 is far more intuitive and offers a user-friendly ticketing experience. The reports in SRO4 are a great surprise, offering the flexibility to craft reports specific to the unique demands of our organization while actually reporting back data accurately and in a clean, digestible format.

SRO4's biggest flaw lies in its rules and conditions based logic that applies to almost every aspect of this system. For all of SRO4's brains, it seems to overthinks things too much. For example, programming a specific fee structure for one scenario and differently for another is frustrating beyond words due to the necessity of chiseling through a healthy list of conditions that act as the 'on/off switch' for the fee scenarios. No matter how intelligent you are, you'll quickly find yourself wishing you'd paid closer attention in rocket science class. And with so many layers of interlaced rules and conditions, a slight modification can completely disrupt the functionality of another rule/condition combo that you worked so hard to perfect a week prior. If there's lemonade to be made of these tart lemons, it's that you're guaranteed to come up with some creative combinations of obscenities that are guaranteed to make any sailor blush.

Despite that frustration, the best part of SRO4 is the support we're getting from the TopTix team. These folks are friendly, results-driven, and fast! Did I mention that they're also pleasant and easy to get along with? You bet I did. And I'll say it again, because these essential qualities seem to be withering in the support industry in general. And if you can't enjoy a professional yet relaxed relationship with your support team, well...what's to enjoy? I really love these rock stars! No matter what my situation might be, I always hang up the phone feeling like I'm in good hands with my team.",,,,,

283,agile ticketing,What is Agile and Why Does It Matter?,Ramya A.,ISR,,Less than 6 months,NGC,Software Advice,2017-12-04,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,,"Responding to Change Perhaps the biggest advantage Agile development practices bring to development teams and businesses in general is its emphasis on responding to change and focus on working on projects that matter when they matter. Agile methods don't force us to attempt to divine the future in 9, 12, or 24-month projections. A properly-oriented Agile team has a list of the most important things they can work on; when they finish the most important thing on that list, they move to the next most important thingand so on, ad infinitum. This type of focus has many benefits: Customers get solutions to the problems they value most, sooner Stakeholders can prioritize things in a progressive fashion reflecting actual market conditions at a given time Developers feel valued, since they're working on things that actually matter and will receive frequent in-depth feedback from the very people using the product (ideally, at least). Accepting Uncertainty The second biggest source of value Agile development brings to an organization is that its practices accept the fact we don't know everything about a project when we first start.This is in stark contrast to more ""traditional"" stage-gate and waterfall approaches, where requirements are expected to be ""complete"" before anyone so much as touches a keyboard to type their first line of code. Agile instead accepts that we will discover more information as we go on; we may find a particular technical solution doesn't meet the needs of customers, or we might discover there's an entirely different problem underneath the stated problem, and by solving problem we can solve not just the proposed issue, but other customer concerns as well. Applying Agile principles to our approach allows us to accept the unknown and prioritize discovery and experimentation to drive out uncertainty before we fully commit to a solution. Faster Review Cycles In order for teams to be both accepting of uncertainty and responsive to change, there's a need for rapid iteration and cyclical, comprehensive reviews as work is completed - to ensure that new discoveries are contemplated and current efforts are evaluated. Most Agile practices either time-box efforts (Scrum) or control the amount of ""work in progress"" (Kanban) to ensure efforts are completed within a reasonable amount of time. Those efforts are then reviewed with customers or customer proxies (such as internal services teams or stakeholder teams). The focus on ensuring prompt reviews and feedback from actual users (or as close to the user as you can get) addresses the most common failings of waterfall approaches - the delivery of a product nobody really wants or likes after a 6-9 month closed development cycle. Greater Flexibility in Releasing Features In addition to faster cycles of review with customers or customer proxies, the focus on delivering working software in time-boxed or effort-boxed iterations of work provides the business as a whole more flexibility in when product should be delivered to end users. In more traditional approaches, releases occur when all the planned work is completedor, even worse, on a date set by stakeholders regardless of how polished the actual work is on that date. Agile approaches, on the other hand, provide sufficient functionality Less Up-Front Work Prior to the advent of Agile development methodologies, not only did product requirements attempt to predict what would be needed in 6-9 months, but they also attempted to be an encyclopedic contract outlining and detailing nearly every single aspect of a product's design and development. It was not uncommon to see Product Requirements Documents (""PRDs"") and Technical Requirements Documents (""Specs"") exceeding fifty or more pages and outlining specific deliverables developers would use as checklists of exactly what to deliver - nothing more and nothing less. Agile instead focuses us on defining and prioritizing problems to solve; collaborating with our developers to design, specify, and revise work needs to be done; and to exert only the amount of effort needed to move a product or project to its next phase. Incurring high up-front costs in investigation, documentation, and contract negotiation is anathematic to the fundamental beliefs outlined in the Manifesto.",Lack of Understanding Flexibility Can Lead to Bad Behaviors Culture Fit Lack of Predictability Integrating Diverse Skill Sets Into Teams Challenges at Scale,"We were able to improve the patron experience in ticket purchase and use; as well as easily train our box office team to use the product.

I'm used to it but new users say it is complicated to learn and the overall theme the online purchaser reports is that it is tough to work through. Figuring out how to generate certain reports can be complicated or tricky because there is so much functionality that it becomes confusing.,"I've always been a fan of Glitnir Ticketing. I've worked with their ownership since my first day on the job and they are a very hands on company and will quickly assist you with any problems. I can't stress that enough, you can email or call and they will promptly work directly with you to figure out the problem or guide you through the steps. Well run company and they worked hard, with me, to quickly address our issues and customize our system to fit our exact needs and wants. They want our system to be the best it can be and make every effort to make it so.",,

All of the representatives and executives that I have worked with over the six years I have used Glitnir Ticketing have been readily available to me and the organization 24/7.","There are a lot of competitors that are offering new and shiny technology. In my opinion Glitnir is not on the forefront of that yet, but they are making strides to get there. I've seen vast improvements in the group ticketing platform, season ticket platform and email platform over the past year, and I am excited to see what comes next.","Glitnir has been very responsive to our wants in needs. They've been able to help us modify our reporting, improved the group portal platform, and as I said earlier, have the best customer service/support team that I have worked with.",,

We've been using them for some time now and once everything was up to speed, the buying process was simple! The features they offer are exactly what we were looking for from the buying process, to the CRM, to the Group Portal and newsletter features. The customer service is great! They usually stay on top of all the details.","The most difficult task is trying to find the report that you are looking for to pull the most accurate information. They offer a wide variety of reports, so there may be one that works just right for you! There are some bugs with the software (not bad) that take time getting use to.","Switching to a new ticket system is like learning how to walk again. It was tough at first, but the customer support was there every step of the way. Their buying process helped our speed of service, data collection and simplified a lot of things we were doing. The FREE CRM is a great added bonus, along with the group portal.",,

I've been amazed at the number of new customers we've brought in who have been able to take advantage of some of our unique ticket promotions without having ever spoken to a member of our ticket sales team. Glitnir's Promo Code setup is so user-friendly that we have literally been selling our popular Chipotle Friends & Family packages in our sleep, racking up sales of our most popular ticket package long after the box office closes. We've sold out all four of our Friends & Family games so far this season, largely because Glitnir's Promo Codes make purchasing the plan online so quick and convenient.","When I first started using Glitnir, I would keep a running list of what I thought were problems with the system -- things that seemed flawed or that just didn't seem to work with what we do here in Hagerstown. As I worked more and more with my Glitnir representatives, though, and they took the time to walk me through each and every ""problem"" I brought up, the list dwindled. At this point, there really are no problems with the system as far as I am concerned. It took me some time and hard work to get comfortable with the Glitnir system, but all the effort was rewarded because at this point I feel like Hagerstown has a ticketing system that suits us perfectly.",I would recommend Glitnir to any user that wants to get more than just the bare bones out of their ticketing system -- anyone who is willing to put in some work so that they can feel totally comfortable with their system and capable of using it to enhance all elements of ticket operations.,,

Gordan, DJ and Ian all put in extra hours to make certain that we were up and ready to roll after having imstalled the system 5 weeks prior to our opening day. They have fielded phone calls on weekends, checked out problems for us after hours and made certain everything was in proper working order before signing off on the job.",Online ticket customers can leave single seats from a transaction. This has been my biggest fault with the system. Our stadium is not that large and on busy nights we will use every reserved seat that we have so eliminating singles is huge for us.,"The Glitnir Ticketing System is a solid tool. For mid to low budget teams looking to have their customer database coupled with their ticket system, I feel it is one of the strongest on the market, presenting great value in addition to it's ease of use.",,

The customer service and helpful attitude they provided was and is fantastic. They worked with us through the entire set up process and really set us up for success and continue to respond immediately even when we have the smallest questions or issues.,"I still find the navigation and orientation to the system a little difficult. It may be because no one here has ever used a system like this. However I find it difficult to teach my workers (mostly students) and administrators how to use the system and for game day sales and even more difficult to show them how to access other features.

That being said, the Glitnir team did a great job showing me how to use it and my translation to others may need improvement.","There is a legitimacy in our department and in our ticketing that wasn't there before. Online and walk up sales are easier to manage and quicker to execute, and reporting sales and attendance is easier and more consistent.",,

324,ticketsage custom solutions,We Love TICKETsage,Trish H.,Box Office Manager,,,,Capterra,2009-09-30,4,4.0,,5.0,,,,"The absolute best thing about TICKETsage is their customer service. When the system was first implemented last summer, with our season tickets being printed and mailed from our office for the first time, we needed to depend on the staff of TICKETsage heavily. We came into the office on the weekend to print the tickets and were on the phone with TICKETsage support multiple times during the day. Since then, anytime we have the slightest problem, we are very comfortable calling (in an emergency) or emailing (if the situation is not dire) TICKETsage support. They are very prompt in returning our calls or email.

The day to day operation of the system is easy to use and dependable and it is pretty much impossible to ""mess up"" an application as the system almost always has you confirm or apply an application after it has been changed. The staff at TICKETsage is friendly and helpful even for us ""non-techy"" computer users.","The TICKETsage system has a lot of features that we do not use to the full potential. They seem complicated and confusing, although after a year of day to day use, I am becoming more comfortable with trying to solve problems before I call for support. Occasionally (maybe 3 or 4 times in the past year) there has been an error that needed to be fixed at the TICEKTsage end of the system. Only once in the past year did the system ""go down"" and was off-line for 15 or 20 minutes.","Overall, we LOVE TICKETsage! The few problems we have had are completely over shadowed by the great things about TICKETsage. I am sure that if we had the time to schedule a session with TICKETsage, they would be more than happy to help us learn how to use the features that we do not fully use and the reports (and there are many) from which we, thus far, have not been able to gather information. I'm sure it's all there, we just need to learn how to use it.",,

If you have a subscriber base, data rollover, speed of processing, and package sales capability are very strong and useful features.",What few problems we had because of our special needs were taken care of in a prompt and courteous manner. Training could be improved with a manual and more personalized training to eliminate user error. In a few cases we found ourselves not understanding parts of the software. TICKETsage has been proactive in solving problems and helping us.,"After years of Ticketmaster, Tickets.com, New Era, and Showare, it is refreshing to find a ticket software that completely fits our needs. Their CEO was a breeze to work with and we settled into our deal with few complications and very little legal oversight. Our legal counsel pretty much said that everything was great with their contract and we should sign, this was a first for us. Their entire staff is to be applauded for their customer service and genuine attitude.",,

It's exceptionally reliable for a hosted platform. I can't say enough about the tech support. They're always helpful; quick to respond and to add or modify features, if that's appropriate. Back-end reporting functions make it easy to generate basic reports or to export data from more complex analysis or marketing purposes. The system maintains reliable, accurate inventories for online and box office sales. Credit card processing is extremely fast, and they made it easy for us to settle directly to our bank. They have managed to balance ease of use with flexibility, making this a good product for almost any venue.","Some parts of the back-end are a bit rusty, although these are mostly cosmetic issues. Currently, online buyers can't use existing patron records resulting in duplicate patron info for orders placed online. I'd like for patrons to have to ability to use an email/password combo to order tickets. There's a tool to merge orders under these duplicate records, but that's a step I'd rather avoid...","In my opinion, of the systems I've looked at, Ticketsage offers services, features and really great technical support at a price point that can't be beat. We ticket about 30 events per year - 12,000 to 15,000 tickets per year - and Ticketsage performs pretty close to flawlessly.",,

Setting up tickets & the ticket website was very easy. One does not need to know any coding language making this a very appealing system to volunteer/charitable groups. If you are in need of a simple system, this is an event ticket system for you. I would highly recommend it to volunteer/charitable groups running an event that need a simple registration system with a ticket output. I personally look forward to the system evolving. Currently the additional fields answers download in a separate report known as ""Guest Surveys"", thus having to merge the entrance list and guest survey list together for a complete report - if you are not good at excel, this would be a hindrance. As well, you can't run multiple events, with different bank accounts, under one Picatic account. As an event planner who has multiple clients, with multiple events, this means running multiple accounts and is inconvenient. All in all, it is a great system that just needs some time to evolve. I love getting my weekly sales reports in my inbox - I don't have to go into the system to see how the tickets are selling. Thank you Picatic - I can't wait to see what you do next!",,,,,

No words can describe the amazing service Tix provides.,"Not many people know about Tix. If more people knew, Tix would be the #1 ticketing system in the world!","I had no background on ticketing systems, Tix manager took me under his wing and now I can create events in minutes. Our reo gives a personalized customer service, based on your company's needs. He's patient and he has a great team, he's the very definition of a good manager. Experiencing a big ticketing company right now and it's disappointing of how poor the training and the customer service is. when you think of a big corporation you think they'll have and provide all tools needed to succeed. In reality, they care about the high fees and selling but not caring how it gets done. Tix cares about the success on both parties and they care about customers providing low fees. Each account is a priority to Tix, they help as much as they can. To a big company, 1 account is nothing, and they make you do the job for them. Tix also cares when creating a new venue map, their team must be geniuses because all I have to do is send them a PDF and they do the rest (at no cost), at the same time they let you know if something doesn't look right of if you missed a row or a seat number. They've saved me from a few mistakes and embarrassment, instead they help me succeed and look good to my superiors. If you're looking for a ticketing company Tix is the right choice. No question is stupid or not important to our rep, he never acts like he is too good to answer he never makes you call the appropriate person to help you, if you have an issue he's there. Thank you!",,

At the time, ZCT didn't have the CC transactions necessary to support our own merchant account. Tix, Inc. supported us with their merchant account.",,,,,

Help library is great. Customer support is excellent.,"Sometimes the reports do not output to excel correctly, but the developer said this is a known issue and is being resolved.","We wanted an easy-to-use system where patrons could select their own seats for events in a 1500-seat venue and our smaller 450-seat theater. Going from our old paper system to TIX was a great decision. We were looking for a reasonable fee structure and solid customer support--TIX has both. Another feature that was important for us was to be able to hide the fee for certain events and TIX makes that easy to do. Sales reports, customer data and back-end management are easy to use and the TIX help library is excellent--anything I have not been able to figure out has been quickly responded to from TIX support via phone or email. I've also been impressed by the personal rapport of my support specialist--when I call, she knows who I am and is familiar with our organization's venues and events. I'm sure she has many clients to attend to, but I have had excellent response to each call or email--always within the same day!Many of our patrons are older and I have heard nothing but positive responses from those who have attempted to make online purchases through TIX. We have some who call or walk in for a ""box office"" experience, and those orders are easily handled. Since our TIX site is branded to look like our own website, many purchasers do not even recognize they have left our website to make their purchase.TIX is exactly what we were looking for.",,

While there are some glitches, overall the system is simple to use and the Customer Service is outstanding! They have enabled me to streamline processes that were consuming more time than humanly endurable with the automatic renewal system. They advise me of the system parameters and what it can do for me, and have educated me to use it proficiently throughout the years. They take ownership of my problems and resolve them by whatever it takes to get the job done, including being most accommodating customizing reports, seat maps, customer letters, emails, etc. as needed and adapting their programming to meet my unique needs, a rare option in this world! I have never experienced more concern for my issues and dedication to resolving them than I have with this staff of experts. They continually enhance and improve their system and incorporate my requests whenever possible. They are truly committed to excellence going above and beyond providing extraordinary Customer Service and are quick to respond to my often urgent needs and resolved issues I deemed hopeless. They listen to my problems, have eased my frustrations and spent hours and hours on the phone with me and my complications over the years. I have worked with other systems that had no one to talk with and no ""phone a friend"" option which I found unbearable.

I looked into ticketing systems I have used in the past that require a lot of support and local maintenance and found a few light weight systems that I could install myself. Since coming on board in 2008, Tix.com has been n amazing support system for our company.These days, I try modeling our own support after Tix. com's.

It can be applied to any sort of event: small events, medium events, or huge events. Oveit covers all the management needs that an event organizer has, as you can easily set up badges for the event, and have a complete and real-time access management. Another useful element is the embed function, which enables the event organizer to sell tickets directly from his website. This is very cost effective as a 3rd party ticket seller can be avoided. And one last thing... it's very easy to use. Big plus on that!","There are so many functions that sometimes you can mix them up, but any organizer can live with that con when you look at the many pros that Oveit has to offer.","I've used Oveit platform for the charity events organized for HOSPICE Casa Sperantei. We've sold tickets in a very smooth way and handled all the event infrastructure with just a couple of clicks. By using the embed system, we were able to sell tickets directly from the event homepage. Also, by collecting data from the people that purchased tickets, we were able to keep in contact with everyone, even after the event has ended.

For a charity that needs cost efficiency, Oveit was a perfect solution. The user experience for an organizer is great and it takes around 5 minutes to set up the event and get it going. Also, with just a couple of clicks to manage the whole event, manpower is reduced to minimum and because of Oveit, one man can do the job of many. Great job!","Check out all the functions that Oveit has to offer and use them, as they will make your life easier.",

Not only did they provide all the core functionality we sought for at the most reasonable price, they also went the extra mile for us more than once to help us set everything up and integrate with other services. We did find some small feature missing from their UX, but it was addressed real fast by the team. All or this with a cheerful tone in e-mails. They already have a good system, but it's clear that they are an Agile team that keeps improving. When you're looking for a top notch event management app that's great value for the money, Ctrl-D recommends Oveit!","Do try it, it's a revelation!",

In 2012, we began a search for a new ticketing solution and came upon SABO. We were impressed then with the flexibility, reporting features, Patron management and integrated marketing. When the problems with Java occurred we were very concerned because our online ticket sales dropped to about 25%, which meant that our phones were ringing off the hook because people could not purchase online. As you all know that was a very trying time. With the new enhancements and re-designs now our online sales is at about 90%!The thinks we are most impressed with are the Patron Management features of automatically assigning attributes based on certain criteria. This is vital as we are a membership organization and we have to keep track of patrons who make donations of $50 or more. SAGO does this seamlessly! The second thing we are thrilled with is the Online Sales flow. Our patrons are very happy with the look, feel and ease of use of online purchasing. This alone has saved the organization a great deal of money! We constantly use the reporting features to keep track of Sales trends and sales volume.

After searching for a ticketing solution for months, SABO stood out amongst the rest because of its informative sales/support team and pricing. Marc in particular (our client relations contact) has gone above and beyond our expectations from day one. Whether supporting a new business with growing needs and constant changes, providing specific and specialty support options, or creating solutions for problems we thought were too great to overcome - Marc constantly surprises us with his ingenuity and ability to meet our needs. Most recently, SABO added Social Network features that once again keep this system current with the growing demands and trend changes of the ticketing industry.","I must say that SABO has a range of reporting features that really help us understand who our customer base is, where they are purchasing from, how they heard about our event, and if they desire to be on our marketing contact list. However, as a client that is always looking for more data, I could use a couple more report options that allow me to understand our customer base with a little more ease of use and streamlined information.",If the pricing doesn't convince you that SABO is in it for the long haul and partnership relationship - then the customer support provided should hit the message home - SABO has genuine concern for its clients and ensures their success with personal attention and response to the needs of its users.,,

There is no easy way to do that. I can't even begin to describe the process in which to accomplish it and most of the time we reprint the ticket by happenstance, not sure how we reprinted it. It's about a 4-5 step process unless there is an easier way that we don't know about.Would still love to see a feature of refunding a ticket price to a donation. As a nonprofit we don't allow refunds on tickets, we do offer our patrons a tax letter on tickets donated back to us. Would love to release that ticket back into inventory and still capture the purchase.",Overall SABO is fairly easy to use and meets most of our needs. Even thought there are a few drawbacks that could easily be fixed I would defiantly recommend this product to any arts organization looking for a better ticketing option. It has continued to bring a professional image of our organization to our patrons. Huge thanks to Justin Baxter for his continued support.,,

689,seatadvisor,SeatAdvisor makes online ticketing easy,John G.,Trustee & IT Strategist,,,NGC,Capterra,2015-08-19,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"Since we first implemented SABO in 2007, our organization has come a long way utilizing technology with our ticketing and online sales. The implementation process was very straightforward, with the largest obstacle being our internal volunteers adapting to the change from paper tickets. The training was done remotely though online collaboration and desktop sharing tools, which still continue today for any support needs which may arise.The SABO interface and seat maps are very clean and professional looking. While we are a small non-profit community theater with 360 seats, we only use a small portion of the functionality. For example, we don't have a need for setting up portals and barcode scanning of tickets at the door as larger venues would use.Setting up new events for our six show season, including the creation of three subscription plans is relatively easy. Fortunately, we set up our season once per year, but adding special events or additional performances on the fly takes no time at all.One area we need to take a look at is the email integration with Vertical Response in hopes of sending out automated pre and post performance emails to ticket holders with relevant information including location, parking, and local dinner show specials with area restaurants.While the per ticket and credit card gateway authorization charges can get high for a small non-profit such as ours, we still feel that SeatAdvisors offers a superior product compared to the competition.",,,,,

The pick your own seat option is very useful! Since we have that option available to our online patron, we have successfully taken our walk up down to virtually nothing.

SABO's customer service is amazing, I put in a ticket and I have answers within 30 minutes or a phone call to solve the problem. The customer service department is better than I would have ever imagined.","The only two things I wish SABO would do is: When a customer pays cash you can enter the cash so it tells you how much change to return to the customer.

Other improvements are the map display, the stability of credit card reconcilliation, their willingness to adapt SABO and make changes to fit our needs, the ease of balancing etc. The staff at Seat Advisor is very open to any of our needs, and when feasible works to make any changes or enhancements we need.","There are rare occassions that because SABO is web based, we lose connectivity or are affected by other SABO patrons.

I'm sure many users would prefer to refer to merchandise as something other than 'tickets.' 'Items' would work great......Also - The 'description' text for events should have more flexibility insofar as editing is concerned.

Perhaps the best thing about Showare is the client services team. Any question or issue is resolved incredibly fast. Sometimes we don't even know of an issue, and it's already remedied, and we are made aware ASAP. They take wonderful care of us and listen to all of our questions and ideas.","When we first decided on Showare, there were a few reports and capabilities that Showare did not perform, that we were used to having. Instead of turning us away, they listened to us and helped us create a new report for our needs. Additionally, there have been things that we thought would be great additions to the system, not only for us, but to other venues as well. A few upgrades later...there they were!","User-friendly, easy to navigate, up to date software, great upgrades, amazing customer service.",,

We have employees who look forward to selling tickets on ShoWare because it is so easy and so intuitive. We are not a huge venue...as an HOA we bring in individual shows as well as season packages. We see the value because we are able to market to residents as well as the surrounding community using ShoWare. We also love the fact that upgrades are regularly introduced with advance notice.

Any functionality problems we've had have been quickly solved.With that in mind, the ease of use of accesso ShoWare for us as a general admission attraction suffers a bit- the amount of bending and adapting we've had to do to make accesso ShoWare work for our needs has created a steep learning curve for Box Office staff as some of the functionality is not necessarily intuitive for what we do.

Also, wish we could create a seating or vendor layout that would be visual for the registrants where they could click on it to select a seat or a booth space they want to purchase. Additionally, created the option to have a 2 step process of registration involved where registrants can be approved first and then they can pay fee. We make this happen ourselves by manipulating the database for us and utilizing the code feature to unlock payments. But, it would be neat if when they applied or registered then administrators would run a report and then check a box beside all the registrants to approve and then it sends an approval email to them. This would make it simple instead of going into each of the 300 profiles and marking a custom field in their schedule. so many steps to approve someone. Each one takes like several screens.

I also wish they would bring back the blocking emails from registering (maybe because the volunteer was not a right fit or they were banned for whatever reason). I also wish we would be able to download and/or contact all registrants in the system, not just by individual site. This would prevent some volunteers from receiving the same email (if they are registered for multiple sites) and would be less time for the administrator in sending out multiple emails for multiple sites.","We have been utilizing TRS for 5 years and the system keeps getting better.

I can train new staff to do a sale, exchange, and refund within an hour. We have over 75,000 patrons per year, over 1000 performances and hundreds of different producers. We also produce our own festivals and programming and most other festivals in our 4 theatre complex. With this variety, we need a system that was flexible and works well with our eyes and.. attitude toward requests from our tenants. Vendini is approachable and focused on making the product work for us. They create a very personal connection to their customers and their support. I can be in touch several times a month trying to accommodate a request from one of our tenants, be it a certain type of reporting, or a membership/package they want to offer. I take these to my rep who works with the appropriate team to accommodate our needs. They have helped me create several specialized reports that give specific producers exactly what they want. They have helped me create seating venues that accommodate special pricing, sections, levels etc. . They have shown me useful ways to use memberships and fees. There have been many upgrades the past couple years, Email Marketing, reporting, ticket agent and patron manager. It's great to work with a company that listens to customers. Great possibilities!","The software is great, but of course not perfect. It can take time and some trial and error to get reports created how you want them. I feel there could still be work to do in this area. Support area is terrific and helpful, especially with urgent/time sensitive requests, but can take a bit longer when it is not priority. I think this is because they take time to find the right team, to give the best answer to solve the issue.",,,
958,vendini,Vendini came on to our radar at exactly the right time with the right features to get the job done.,Charles J.,Producing Artistic Director,,2+ years,NO,Capterra,2018-02-13,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Vendini, on top of being a box office system, is a complete marketing solution. It offers you the ability to combine your patron databases into one centralized location and then build the database automatically as your attendance increases. You can then use this information for email marketing (a similar system and set up to Constant Contact but I think more intuitive), direct mailings and patron management (such as the scheduling of development activities). The ability to review patron history is invaluable. And you can customize the tagging and grouping of patrons to suit your needs. Additionally, the software provided a website solution for us.",,"It has changed the way we do business. I can directly attribute our success in the recent years to our implementation of this program. It decreased workload, increased quality of output and made our patrons stand-up and take notice. Vendini continues to make upgrades to areas of the system. They recently added a patron database management section with basic development tools like the ability to schedule calls or tasks. And their email marketing recently got a facelift. So some of my biggest concerns are being addressed.",,

By the time someone has typed a donation letter, I've already processed payment and printed the tickets. It is, hands down, the best ticket system for managing not only the ticket sales, but the relationship with the customer. Yeah, I could do a one-time ticket sale with EventBrite or BrownPaper Tickets (whatever they're called), but I don't have a long running capture of deep customer spending and attendance history.","The only thing that we ran up against was that pew style seating is hard to section off in the software and, inevitably, it was easier to create general ""rooms"" for reserved sections rather than using the seating chart for a church sanctuary. It's wonderful for theater seating!",,,
960,vendini,I have used Vendini for two years as an online ticketing system for events.,Verified Reviewer,Associate Music Director,,,NGC,Capterra,2018-04-03,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Vendini offers several options to enhance your experience when selling tickets for an event or show. You are able to use your website and logo as well as the logo of the band or event you are selling tickets for. My favorite option is the ability to add a donation to individual's purchases. I worked with a Foundation that was raising funds for scholarships. Being able to add an additional donation button gave me the opportunity to earn additional funds for my Foundation. In addition, I loved the marketing portion. To be able to send an email to patrons through vendini instead of constant contact was super easy.",The function that I liked the least was that you are limited to character usage and design when it comes to marketing your events. Sometimes the buttons are difficult to use and change when trying to make the email blasts more appealing.,,,

The box office software and apps are extremely easy to use have worked flawlessly with not lag or interruption. Our ticket sales have increased significantly since using Vendini, and season ticket subscribers increased from 10 to 45 in one year. Our fundraising has increased too as patrons easily add tip jar donations to each ticket purchase. Vendini customer service is outstanding - every person I have ever spoken with, email, or chatted with is polite, responsive, and knowledgeable. The additional features of credit card processing, equipment rental, patron database, email marketing, and more, Vendini is truly and all-in-one solution that we highly recommend.","Apps are not compatible with Android devices; and inability to sell gift cards while using Vendini credit card processing.

The system is used across our Performing Arts Department at a large urban high school. I do not have a staff other than the students in the class. This is what is so wonderful about Vendini, it can do a little or it can do a lot. The students who are trained on the program are learning industry standard Arts Management skills. It goes well beyond just ticketing but also incorporates easily social media such as email and Facebook. Since using the program our shows sell out, revenue is way up, and we are able to have an impressive professional face. I cannot say enough good things about the services the program offers. In fact, it has been so successful that our district, the second largest in California, is taking it district wide based on the success and recommendations from my site.",It will change how you market your shows! It will make ticket sales exciting for you and your staff. The reports features and ability to use the program on tablets and phones will have you checking sales in the middle of the night just for fun :-),

Setup of new events is a snap.","The reporting features seem to do what we want but it can be difficult to figure out what you need to do to get the report you want. On the other hand, the customer support is always there to help and explain things as needed. The email functionality needs to be updated as well--not terribly modern looking emails, and the functionality is a bit buggy.","Helped us sell more tickets by giving us online ticket sales, email marketing, reporting and patron management all in one package.",,

Navigating the Vendini app is relatively simple. There are a variety of ways to find your information. Keeping various patron bases is extremely helpful Being able to look at sales based on single ticket sales or subscriptions is very important. Being able to send marketing emails is a terrific asset.,"I am not thrilled with the relatively new (appx one year) layout of the events page for a particular event. Have to open multiple windows to get all of the information, such as total sales. In the past, that was all on one screen. The email marketing has improved but would love for it to be even more like a ""constant contact"" program where you could easily import photos and drag and drop various elements.

Backoffice set up, with reporting capabilities and e-mail marketing, gives us all necessary tools to take full advantage of the information collected during hte ticketing process.",Some aspects of ticketing beyond single ticket sales could be more user friendly.

I wish we had advisories about that.,"I've been using Vendini ticketing software for eight years and have trained countless numbers of students at my University Box Office how to use the software in a quick amount of time. As our staffing changes each semester, and our events can change on a dime, the ability to train quickly, make changes instantly, and have flexible software that is easy to use, is imperative. I created some great relationships with the Vendini support team so that when there is an occasional hiccup, I know who to call and receive courteous and helpful service. But perhaps the most important aspect of Vendini is that it gets the job done. Not everything has to be complicated, and Vendini isn't!","For a box office that has rotating staff that don't have the time to make operating ticketing software their first priority, this is a great option. I can teach someone to use Vendini at the window in five minutes to get us through a busy show. Then, teaching the more intricate levels of reporting, exchanges etc. is easy to build on. I have a student staff of 30 and often many of them change each semester based on their school schedules. Ease of use and success at accomplishing the task are my main priorities and Vendini accomplishes both. It is also affordable!",
968,vendini,Confident all in one ticketing/marketing solution both you and your venue can grow with,Russell T.,Box Office Manager & Event Coordinator,,,NO,Capterra,2015-03-23,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,"We've been using Vendini since June 2011. One of the major reasons we switched ticketing providers was for ease of use. Our box office is staffed by a rotating group of students who need to be trained in a relatively short period of time. Vendini's POS TicketAgent is pretty self explanatory and my students are able to pick it up almost immediately. On the backend, building events the way we need them is a breeze and it almost seems like the reporting capabilities are limitless. It really makes my job easier by improving the flow of information to our marketing team and development office. As far as peripherals are concerned, Vendini is really ""with it"" in terms of functionality and integration. Our box office was able to upgrade to cash draws that electronically integrate with the POS and we added iPads & iPods so that we could offer print-at-home and mobile tickets. The apps developed to work with these devices are really cool and really easy to use. We get compliments from our customers all the time when we scan their ticket on an iPod or sell them tickets an iPad. I feel really confident knowing that they continue to program new tools and update existing ones to help make event ticketing simpler for venues like mine. What's also really helpful is that they have excellent training and continued learning opportunities through a comprehensive online support catalogue (including both written & video tutorials). It's a great resource. In addition, they host an annual Vendini Member Conference where you can network with system experts and other venues using their solution. It's an invaluable experience to learn more about their solution and how to get the most out of it. In terms of customer service, Vendini has been open to our feedback and responsive to all our requests and has always found a solution for any problems that we have experienced.",,,,,

I had very little training and had to hit the ground running -- and I was anxious about messing it up. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it is really very intuitive and smooth. We have an older patron base who had been used to buying their tickets by mail or personally on the phone; I was concerned that they might not adapt too well. Lo and behold, it is less than a year and online sales account for almost 60% of total sales with almost no complaints. A real tribute!",This is hard to say.

The agents took the time to answer all of my many questions with professionalism, were knowledgeable about the service, and very people-friendly.They had me set up for business in no time. My customers found it to be a easy convenient way to purchase tickets to my event. I also had 24/7 access to my account to review and keep track of all my transactions.As far as the pricing for AttendStar online service compared to others (some charged less, some charged more) It worked best for me because of the high quality of service I received.I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family.",,,,,

The capacity of this software improves about every 2 weeks when they release a new update to the system. It's grown exponentially since we started using it about 2 years ago. They now provide amazing resources: training video tutorials, webinars, a Facebook group page to network with other users, etc. They just keep upgrading the system and adding new features so regularly, I truly believe Giveffect can literally do anything you need it to.","Nothing really. The only downside for us is the price. Honestly the price is a great value for what you get, it's just a little high for smaller non-profits...but you can literally do everything you need to.","Before Giveffect, we were using BlackBaud Raiser's Edge, and no one in our office could use it well. Just to learn how to use it, our employees had to pay a large fee and go to a week long training seminar. It was not convenient, and that knowledge was lost as employees turned over. I managed to figure out how to use it myself, but wasted a lot of time. Training others on my team was next to impossible. During the initial demo, we could tell that Giveffect was leaps and bounds ahead of Raiser's Edge. With Giveffect, the software itself is very intuitive, and the provided free training video tutorials and webinars are really helpful. Even before those resources were available, it was so easy for me to just start using the system. I've since been able to set up my entire team using the system, and they've had few to no difficulties learning to use it. Our focus is now on building better relationships with our donors rather than fighting with a system to enter gift information. Giveffect has been absolutely wonderful for our team.","It has so much potential. The integration with other services is really nice, i.e. mail chimp for email marketing. They've recently added auction software, you sell event tickets, donate button on your website, volunteer management, literally everything you need.",

The time savings for our staff has been huge! Also, the ongoing training opportunities, customer support and ever evolving aspects have been incredibly helpful and have allowed us to make our processes even more efficient. The software is also very intuitive and easy to use/understand. In addition, the team at Giveffect actually listens and evolves the software based on the growing needs of users and the clients we serve.",I have yet to have a negative thought about Giveffect.,"""By switching to Giveffect we have eliminated having to use multiple platforms to function. Everything was separate for us before and we basically were spending a ton of time moving between software, platforms and systems that didn't communicate well together and/or did not allow us present the look and feel of our agency. With Giveffect we can easily accomplish all of our tasks from one platform AND on the front end of things it integrates seamlessly with our own website! From the get go, Giveffect's customer service has been top notch - they've had an answer for every question we've had and their team is readily available whether it is through their online ""Chat with Us"" feature, via phone or via email. They also do an amazing job of listening to feedback and the needs of their clients then turning around and implementing updates which allows them to offer all of us a continually evolving solution. I can't even begin to explain the amount of time we now have available each day to focus our energies on the important stuff - the kids in our program and our mission. Highly recommended!""","I would encourage you to call those using the software for references and also TRY the demo! We did both of those things and haven't had one regret. Our biggest hangup initially was the migration to a new platform, but their team helped us handle this with ease. It seems to good to be true, but it is so worthwhile.",

There are no tedious forms to fill out to change or add fields, you can do most of it yourself. The campaigns are so easy to set up and easy to promote. Once your staff is familiar with the user experience troubleshooting is incredibly easy to manage. Donations come in with little to no issue. The team is so incredibly responsive and if we need something done differently it's almost always made available on the next upgrade. The tutorials are quick and painless to sit through and you can access them whenever you need to. Their webinar series is great and they do a wonderful job of keeping us up-to-date regarding changes, new functionality and upcoming tutorials and training.","There are a few pieces that are only available in the upper tier, which is a bummer. Also, the number of administrators we can have is limiting. The cost to add what we need is probably as much as moving to the next tier - which is slightly higher than we're prepared to pay right now.","Makes my job so much easier.

- I do not understand how I can get the complete list of all the anagraphical, fiscal and administrative data related to all members (this is our most important administrative need). For each member we need to show: Name, Second Name, Italian Fiscal Code, date of request and date of acceptance of the Association, address and email or telephon number, if he is Active or not. If we receive a Fiscal Visit we have to present easily the complete list of all these data of all our members.

- Raklet does not still allow to keep a register of Contacts of Persons that are not yet MEMBERS. Therefore we cannot envoy Newsletter to them, nor envoy promotional messages or Invites.

- The graphic possibilities of Newsletters might be potentiated.

- It might be good to let New Members of our Association to read Italianinformations about Raklet and few but clear instruction about its use.

- It might be developped the use of Raklet as Social Network of Members.

- It might be developped the use of SMS for the payment of the fees!",I am the President of a No Profit Italian Cultural Association (we perform Ancient Classical Theatre in Milano) and I can assure that a software like Raklet can give a very important help in the administration of the Association (a complex task) and in the relationships with members.,"GO ON and let us to have also a complete Italian version, if possible!

I really like the approach to sharing new developments in the community. All functionalities are mainly focussed on customer needs and once they are developed they will be released to other organizations as well. The Raklet team is very friendly and is willing to help and assist with any adaptions and where ever possible. Their development prices are quite competitive.,"It seems to be an ongoing project where major developments can be only expected if paid for. This means that basic functionalities should be checked before a decision is made. Adaptions will cost you extra. A high number of smaller developments are risking to get a kind of ""messy code"" - Therefore, in my opinion, a basic revision of the Raklet code every now and then would be a reasonable measure.","We are using Raklet as a membership management tool in combination with the private social network. For our members, it is implemented as a membership area, where they can share their details and information about themselves as well as details about their affiliation. The details are basically our stock of data about our members. So they have to keep their details updated and we save time for other tasks. We are also using the events function of Raklet which enables us to sell tickets to our members and the public charging them different event ticket prices. That is very practical because it is automatically checked whether one is a member or not. We are also using the Email function which enables us to send automated emails on the basis of pre-designed forms. Another important function for us was the relatively new developed function of Raklet ""pages"" which enabled us to publish content within the private social network that should be seen from our members only. This was a crucial point to us because we had this area on our website first and were not willing to have a double login, one for Raklet and one for the member area on our website. Therefore, we are glad that we have had the support of the Raklet team and would recommend you to use Raklet.","GO ON and let us to have also a complete Italian version, if possible!

The cost-per-ticket is less (less if you pre-print) AND SimpleTix helps us figure out the Square pass-through fees and include them in the service fee cost. Had no issues setting up Square. I like that anyone can use their phone to scan with the app. To be fair, at the time of this review I have used the website to setup a pretty decent ticket portal, but we haven't tested it at the door yet. We are excited that we can change the email form letters that people get when they order. I think getting actual labeled tickets makes the guests feel more confident as well.","I don't think it's a con, but in order to maximize the program/website, you may have to ask a few questions. There was no issue for me on that part, I received a more-than-thorough response any time I needed it. (I accessed help by phone and email, both were outstanding and easy.)","Organizing attendees for a five-day festival and contest, so we want to track who is interested in attending and be able to promote with discount codes and other perks. Also able to issue manual tickets, have them emailed, or sent as text to phone. Also lots of ways to set up your site with a theme, though I decided the standard look was the best for me. Honestly, I like having the ability to customize and this site allows so much customization. Also, they don't hold back all the features for the premium membership, they're generous with the features you get compared to other, more expensive sites even if you stick to the basic level. I would totally use the premium features, but we aren't at that budget level yet. However, under a less amount for each ticket is a great deal.",,

We vetted many options for ticketing platforms for our event, and SimpleTix was a clear front-runner from our first discussion. The pricing was very reasonable and competitive, and the functionality of the platform met our essential needs for the customization that was required for the specific event, which called for a custom floor plan and reservation system.","There were some seemingly very basic features that we were told couldn't be done. Needs and requests such as changing the color of a reserved seat to the color red or black upon reservation, or the specific numbering of seats in a certain configuration were not met, as we were told things like this couldn't be done. From the outside, functionality requests such as these seem very simplistic, so it was a shame these smaller things couldn't be accomplished.","Overall our experience with SimpleTix was tremendous! I cannot say enough good things about the communication, care, responsiveness, and helpfulness that our reps offered. All correspondence and requests were met in a very timely manner, the support for customization and edits was absolutely fantastic! Completely wonderful customer service!! 5 stars!",,

We chose SimpleTix based on the fact that it offered not only a ticketing solution, but also a shopping cart solution. The learning curve for SimpleTix is not too steep, the company offers dozens of self-help video tutorials that helped alot in the beginning. Since I am not a web developer, it probably took me longer to get the site up an running than would be a professional developer, but I am very happy that I took the time to learn the application. Now I can add and modify events with a few clicks, add new images, promotional banners, promo codes, products, and other pages to the site without going through a web developer. Now for the fun part, the ticketing side works great and everyday we get a bcc email from customers who have bought event tickets online. The system works and it's very cost effective for all the components your get. We are very happy we chose SimpleTix.","For what we use SimpleTix for, I really can't think of any con's.","We like working with SimpleTix because they are a young, growing company and we feel we can grow with them. The service is 5 star and if a problem does crop up, they are quick to remedy the situation. The site has so many features that we have not utilized all of them yet.

With some learning, I was able to create a seating chart, assign differing prices to seats (even within different rows and seating blocks), and integrate the software to payment gateways seamlessly. The customer support I received was excellent, and really helped me (not knowing any css programming) customize the software per my requirement. The turnaround time for my queries was quite fast, with support available on weekends. Despite a couple of concerns as I have mentioned in the ""Cons"" section, I will definitely use Simpletix again for all of my ticketing needs in the future and recommend it to others.","One major concern I faced was that I had to redo the entire seating chart (with the complicated layout and the differing prices) 1 day before our launch due to some software issue. I did receive support for this, but I would have liked to avoid the last minute scramble. Also, updates to the code in the background caused a few minor changes, but I did get good customer support in addressing them.Finally, I found that the help and user guides were somewhat confusing in the way they have been organized, and can be arranged in a more intuitive fashion.",,,

SimpleTix was recommended to us, so got in touch with them and they walked us through the entire process from set-up to final close-out.

I signed up for their personalized web support when I started, which I would recommend for anyone like me who isn't particularly tech-savvy. Aron was great about helping me answer subsequent questions that were specific to my site and not in FAQs. He even created a video tutorial in about 15 minutes based on one of my questions. So, good continuous improvement, too!","The only reason I didn't give five stars is that I actually did have to ask for help a couple of times.

- I love the ability to connect with other systems and the OTAs

- I appreciate the help from reps. They are efficient, professional and knowledgeable. If they're not sure about an answer, they check before stating it as true. Other support staff has not been as helpful.","- Reliability - It seems that with every fix that is released, one issue is solved but then another problem occurs or key functions are removed.

- Slow loading

- Need the ability to custom design the manifests

- Communication - I wish there was more communication as to when updates are released and what the update includes.

- It can be very time consuming to get stuff completed. I.e. removing bar codes from our system, updating the training website to match the live site, etc...

- The email/SMS notifications should be an easier process. Creating and editing them is difficult and time-consuming. They are a great feature but need to be more user-friendly.

- We have created so many workarounds for our charters department. It is not a usable system for our charters division without these workarounds.

- Not having the ability to edit some of the hard-coded wording on our website along with the receipt portion that guests receive when printing their tickets.

- Need the ability to archive old stuff like employees, agents, activities, etc...

- Need the ability to put date bands around everything. It's frustrating to have to link and unlink activities depending on availability.

- Reports not being the correct i.e. report by agent, summary by activity

- The reports available for accounting purposes are not detailed enough or contain so much additional, unneeded information that manipulating the report isn't any faster than the other system we have in place.",,,

-The site is very easy to maneuver through. At first i wasn't sure what to click and where to go but after playing around a little bit, it was mostly self explanatory and most people would have no problem using it.

-EXTREMELY quick in getting our site up and running. It was less than 24 hours from the time i sent Louis our seating chart and we started selling tickets.

In the past, we would make under $1000 on our silent auctions and would have to deal with the vultures hovering around the tables. With the Accelevents silent auction, people are bidding constantly and I LOVE that my guests get a text message once they are outbid. No longer do they have to run over to the tables constantly to see if they are still the top bidder. They have it all in the palm of their hand. Also, as the primary organizer of the event for 2 years, as ""go time"" approaches, paranoia sets in and I start to second guess whether everything is set to go. This year I messaged them in the wee hours of the morning the night before the event and got an almost immediate response as well as getting some last minute questions answered just hours before the event started.

Everything went very smoothly and the whole experience was a plus, plus, plus! One real benefit to Accelevents was their 24/7 online support. This was particularly helpful to me because I often worked imputing auction data at night, so any questions or small issues that surfaced after business hours could be easily addressed. The team at Accelevents was very responsive and helpful. Our bidders loved the auction site, the mobile capabilities, and found the checkout and payment process was a breeze. At the end of the auction Accelevents provided downloadable spreadsheets of the entire bidding process as well as the winning bidders and their payment details. Another win-win for us was the affordability of the Accelevents rate structure. A final benefit to using Accelevents is that we can keep our account information online so that we can use the platform over and over for future raffles, bidding or donation opportunities. I would highly recommend this service for any of your auction or online donation needs.","Sometimes when I was inputting text for an auction item the cursor popped back to the beginning of the paragraph. It was frustrating and slowed me down. However, when I reached out to the Accelevents team, they acknowledged the problem right away and confirmed they were working to fix it.

This required us to list the item numerous times rather than having the top couple of bidders win the item. Also, we had a wine pull and a fund-a-cause during the evening. Normally, we would keep track of who purchased the wine and who funded the cause and bill them at the end of the evening. With the Accelevent software, people would have to pay for the wine, fund-a-cause, and auction winnings in three separate transactions.

The connection to Stripe worked quickly and easily. I did make my own small donation through the site because the first payment through Stripe takes about a week - subsequent payments only take a couple of days, so I had the auction winner's money in my organization's bank account within 48 hours.

1607,repairshopr,A great inventory management tool that's easy to use for all employees!,Tanmay M.,Audio Engineer,,1-2 years,NGC,Capterra,2019-03-04,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"What I like most about RepairShopr is the flexibility it allows its users in creating and maintaining varying degrees of inventory items. What if you had 2 products that were ""technically"" the same but varied in price, varied in build quality, etc. RepairShopr allows you to create those categories from the bottom up so you can create as much nuance as needed between various inventory items while abstracting away the ""back end"" of these complex rules to other users. This is great because you can have rather complex ""if then else"" scenarios in play for how certain items are to be used and the program is able to create conditionals that only ""pop up"" certain items which match the complex rules that the administrator can create. This ensures that employees don't need to be told to remember these rules: As long as they work within the system, they will never make a mistake (unless it's human error, of course).","What I liked least about RepairShopr is the interface to switch between users. It's very easy, while in a rush, to overlook that another user was signed in previously. While a huge portion of that is human error and employees not paying attention, perhaps a little more thought into the user interface would prevent this human error from occurring. Perhaps, adding a picture of the employee's face or some sort of visual avatar would be great so an employee knows that another employee is signed in. I think this, overall, ties into the user interface for RepairShopr which can be somewhat technical and very utilitarian. This isn't a bad thing but a more well thought out user interface that is far more human friendly could be extremely beneficial for users overall.",,,
1608,repairshopr,Not just for Retail Computer Shops,Charissa P.,Operations Manager,,2+ years,NGC,Capterra,2019-03-02,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"The integration with other programs makes this unstoppable!This ties a CRM to your POS to your ticketing system. Being able to integrate all of these makes this system one of the most powerful I've worked with. It doesn't feel overbearing either. I worked with Kaseya BMS and Connectwise and both of those felt like beasts. This took a lot of key elements that those two systems have and brought them down to a retail level at a price that all companies should be able to afford.One of the best parts is that they are always integrating new features and squashing bugs. I was always amazed at how often new useful tools were being added. I'm pretty sure they don't have a huge team, but it felt like there must be hundreds of them with what was being accomplished.","Integration with Quickbooks Desktop is limited, but Quickbooks online is excellent. I wish it had the ability to map out locations to dispatch technicians too. It will track where your clients are at, but if you are trying to schedule multiple field techs, it would be ideal if you could see specific open tickets on a map (Maybe ones labeled ""Onsite"") and then be able to assign them to technicians based on location.","If you track inventory, deal with repair tickets, and need to keep up with marketing to your client base, then this is unbeatable. When I was operations manager for a Retail and B2B MSP we switched our retail side from Connectwise to Repairshopr and it was like night and day. It connected quicker, gave us access to our inventory, integrated with Quickbooks online, and gave us custom-ability to really make it fit our business model. As operations manager I was able to build this around our existing processes and make it flow seamlessly.I now have moved to a telecom that could benefit from this, and the only reason I haven't switched are the two cons I listed. Both of them are offered by Quickbooks own ticketing system.Don't let their niche market of Retail ISP shops fool you. I've heard of this being integrated into auto shops and other mechanical fields. If you are in a business that dispatches any sort of technician, then this is the product you need.",,

Repairshopr though has set the bar in my opinion. Repairshopr has really carved out a niche in the repair community. One of the most basic and simplistic things that sold me was the feature that lets you send out a automated email that is customized to say the customers name so it makes it look like you took the time to sit down and write this email. They call this their ""Marketr"" feature. You can actually set it to do any kind of email but where this sold me on Repairshopr was how you can have it follow up with the customer to make sure their repair is doing well and you can set this at different intervals. I have not changed it but by defaults it sends 2 emails asking how things are going the first 2 weeks and then another follow up in 90 days. I am big in to customer service and when I saw this feature, I knew I had to have Repairshopr. The time this saves is indispensable. I have really had a good experience with Repairshopr overall. Down time is almost non-existent. Any issues I have had where I have had to contact support has been really positive. I also like to see that my money is going to a constntly improving product.

I did a lot of on-site work, so I needed something that was ""cloud"" based so I could log in and make an invoice on the spot. There was no real organization or structure to my invoice system, other than a folder where I would drop paid stuff vs unpaid. RepairShopr changed the way I do business, my ability to track and maintain tickets (which I previously did by hand on paper), and gave me a module to track and follow up with my customers, which I had not been doing previously. What I was doing before worked for me at the time, but once I got RepairShopr I realized how much time I was waisting, and how ""broken"" my system of doing things really was.","The initial setup was tough; everything has a learning curve, and I'm pretty good at figuring stuff out. Modification of each module and the fields inside the modules took a lot of time to customize to fit my business needs. There are still parts of the software that I am not utilizing to their full capacity, partially because I've never needed to, and partially because I am not sure I want to spend the time to set them up.That being said, the fact that you can modify each module and field makes the application of this software available to many different markets, not just computer/electronics repair",Made my life easier!,,

We've used other order management systems and this is one of the best systems for what it does. The management software has everything we need to streamline our store from purchase orders, inventory management, check-in/check-out, managing employees, and everything in between. Features are robust and branding can be customized to give customers a great experience while in your store. Post repair, we use the Marketr features and reporting to measure customer satisfaction. Integrates w/ Quickbooks and several apps. Constantly updated with new features and development. Couldn't run our shop without it.","Most everything I have had issues with over passed on to the development team.

In the rare case we need further explanation of a feature or we require support the support team is second to none. Price is very fair for everything it does. Our company completely relies on this product.","We would like to see the open invoice reminder section be developed. When relying on it for invoicing so heavily, its key to ensure constant communication is occurring between customers with outstanding balance and company.

While there is a steep learning curve and the software has it's own quirks and specific ways of doing things (or not doing things), it's very inexpensive in comparison and is very robust. The free version is completely free with no strings attached!","The free version is pretty much fully functional for our needs. The automated invoices are very professional looking and automate emails when an order is completed (once clicking the proper button on the site). You can keep up with the quantity of goods and keep track with how many are bought and sold over various time periods. The ticketing system works great and it's easy to tell if customers are past due with payments as well. Repeat invoices from month-to-month can be automated which is a HUGE plus and seems to always work! Designed for the IT business, but can be used for anything!","I rated low in certain aspects because the system is very convoluted compared to other softwares in this space. It seems like it takes extra steps and multiple pages to get to ""checkout."" I have to keep a cheat sheet handy because there isn't a simple way to invoice a customer. It would be nice if all this can be done from one screen, but the user must go to a different webpage for each step. Something else that is aggravating is the way the invoice numbering works. It's automatic and I have yet to find a way to change it. Each invoice can be changed manually, but that takes extra steps as well. None of this may matter to you, and with my subscription being free, I can't complain much. However, if I were paying, this would be something causing me to look elsewhere.",,,

We used connectwise prior for 5 years (with a homemade xero link) and have not looked back. We've got 5 staff and do everything from ""classic"" IT to managed and sales. But no retail as such.The way we're using it is to leave accounting to Xero and all ticketing to RS, which is their respective mainstay. I.e. we push all the ticket invoices to xero (and re-sync them if there are changes) but don't necessarily rely on RS in relation to reconciliation. Let's face it, with credit notes, split payments, etc, etc it's impossible to recon back 100%. Which is why you have an accounting system.The development team appears to have worked a lot since we joined last September with new features popping up pretty much every week.Coming from connectwise, training effort and setup was NIL in comparison! The system is easy to use and get used to.One thing is that it looks like the development of features is faster than the updates to the self-help support system. But support is fast to respond, so that 's a minor issue.",,,,,

That is very unfortunate for us with over 5,000 subscribers in non-traditional subscription packages. Reporting take a bit of time to get used to.

We can compare sales year over year, create campaigns for marketing and development, and so on. All layers of the database including ticket sales and donations speak to each other so we can pull reports for almost anything. Not to mention, if I do not know how to do something the support team will assist me. My background is customer service and the Patron Manager team exceed my expectations. They are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. They are great teachers. I also like how this program is customizable. There are tons of additional applications (some paid, mostly free) that can be added to PatronManager. These additional applications are very helpful. I recently downloaded one that will allow me to manage our volunteer program. Its truly a lifesaver.","One con is the response time for support. We do have the ability to mark the urgency of a support request, and they will respond immediately for urgent requests, but it would be nice to get a quicker response for even non urgent matters. Sometimes the little issues are still a big deal.",It has facilitated significant growth in ticket sales and fundraising by making it possible for us to have a 360 degree view of everyone in our database.,,

Ease of reporting, either using pre-made reports that come built in, or by customizing our own for specific details. Features are constantly being added - a highlight of any month is reading through Release Notes! Because my department is so small, I have come to depend on PM to house institutional knowledge that would otherwise be lost if even one member of our team left the organization. Building and managing inventory could not be easier. Love that I can customize email templates - has made invoicing directly from PM so easy. Chatter makes communicating with our student staff a breeze, and I love that I am able to work from home using PatronManager when weather or school closings are an issue. Have wifi, will travel.","There definitely has to be someone on staff who can be an admin that is well versed in most of the smaller troubleshooting issues, so that you're not constantly relying on PM Support. However, the online training and help modules are so robust, that this is not a problem. There is always help available, either online, or through the fantastic client services department that handles support requests.",It has facilitated significant growth in ticket sales and fundraising by making it possible for us to have a 360 degree view of everyone in our database.,,

All-volunteer organization has some unique processes, and we have been able to customize PatronManager to accommodate our show attendance invitation system, for example. Also, because it's cloud-based and, once set up, most user procedures are fairly straight-forward, we've been able to decentralize a number of data management tasks. Committees manage their own data, rather than one database administrator (also volunteer) needing to be responsible for all collection and reporting. We also like the ability to clone donation forms (non-complex ones) ourselves, to customize them for specific purposes.","Developing reports is more challenging than many of our members can handle technically, so that remains largely the purview of a very small number of people (1-2). Implementation was generally smooth, despite some (inevitable) resistance to change. If there are multiple people qualifying donations and ticket orders, that process needs to be actively managed. Without active management, qualification can get a back-log, which (appropriately) results in temporary dupes in the system.",It has facilitated significant growth in ticket sales and fundraising by making it possible for us to have a 360 degree view of everyone in our database.,,

Their customer service and online help is world class, and keeps getting better each year with additional webinars and added content. Their process for keeping the database 'clean' is very helpful and avoids the duplication of records. The product is stable. Downtime is almost non-existent - we've had perhaps 3 incidents over 5 years of not being able to access the database and even then it was for a very short period of time with minor-to-no impact to operations.","The only 'negative' about the product was during our initial setup. The ease of data import was over-hyped. Templates were provided but the brunt of the work had to be done by us. This was five years ago and I'm going to guess they have found processes to make it easier for their customers to import data. All of this said, once they received the templates populated with our data the database was set up correctly.",It has facilitated significant growth in ticket sales and fundraising by making it possible for us to have a 360 degree view of everyone in our database.,,

We now have access to information and data in ways that were not possible with our previous systems. The support team has been very helpful in solving problems and guiding us in different directions as we test the limits of what we want to do.

I can create recurring events with customer payment facilities attached easily, run detailed reports to understand booking trends, collect customer information for mail outs. Bookwhen even offers creativity to make the customer facing pages the same colours as my brand, upload my company logo, attachments, feature social media buttons etc.Bookwhen's own features even prompt me to gear my business in new ways: various ticket types offer the ability to sell to the customer in various avenues, without over-complicating things. Even when I wanted to offer a commission-based element to my business that they didn't already support, I approached the team to see if they would code something specifically to support my business needs and together we made it happen. This sort of service is second to none.The best part is that anytime I've ever needed support (which is a lot) I can use the instant chat feature, email and even call the support team to get approachable service and considered help.Within 2 years using Bookwhen my business had grown from a sole trader to a large limited company - without such a fluid booking ability for my customers this would have never been possible.The subscription price is competitive and the features and service are top notch, I fully recommend Bookwhen.",Using this software makes scheduling events and customers payments and reporting easy.,

There were many good products on offer, but nothing that gave me what exactly what I was looking for...there was always a compromise somewhere. I then found Bookwhen and it was a perfect fit. It has revolutionized the way we operate our business. It is user-friendly, very easy to navigate both backends and for our guests and it has a great design/layout which matched the look and feel of our website. Bookwhen also offers quick and professional support whenever you need. I was able to share feedback, so when the new system was introduced with the new improvements, I felt that my feedback was taken into account and that we had grown together! It really is a fantastic booking system, our business is running at 100% occupancy and I feel that this is partly due to the ease of online bookings. We will be going into our 5th year with Bookwhen and I cannot recommend it highly enough.","I feel I have a personal relationship with the support team and that I am valued.

They coordinate a drive up from the south to New England every 2 weeks, and need to register all of the information about the animals (where they're going, their health records, etc) and also assure that each dog has an appropriately sized kennel on the van. It's a little confusing, but because of the nature of the business, it's really important that everything be done safely and efficiently. Bookwhen allows us to set up transports, register the dogs, and take down information not only on the rescue the dog is coming from but also their new home. I use Bookwhen for some other, routine businesses that need yoga classes or other things run, but ultimately what keeps me recommending them for scheduling is that Bookwhen works for complicated businesses who need to take in a lot of info from customers, customers need different ""seats"" (crate sizes) and sometimes other information at intake.

Customer service is brilliant. We rarely wait more than 5 minutes for a chat response. They listen to our feedback and it been great to be able to influence improvements for ourselves and for other users.,There are a couple of things we'd like Bookwhen to be capable of but they are fairly minor and the company have already promised to add them to their development plan so I'm pretty confident we'll see changes over the coming months.,,,

It's also easy for coaches to check on class attendance and it's veratile enought that we can use it for all of our needs.,Its clunky to keep track of cash payments and doesnt have a dedicated page for taking register once the class begins.,"Dont underestimate Bookwhen. A tiny application compared to some other software booking packages but it's versatile, powerful and great to use. My clients find booking easy and repeat bookings even easier.

While they do have some integration capabilities with payment processors and such, those capabilities are very limited.

If I accidentally click on our own account link, I can't sign in as admin, so I have to re-enter the general Bookwhen page to log in. Also, when we send customers a link to our page, it seems to send them in to one particular time slot, and the less logical among them don't realise they need to press back to get out to all the available booking slots.","We run a sling library for local parents, holding three sessions each month. We're volunteers doing it for free. We were finding that far too many families were turning up for us to deal with, meaning they had to wait ages to see us, and we were stressed, run off our feet, and running over time, ending up late to collect children from school and nursery. We set up a Bookwhen account so we could organise the sessions (so everyone doesn't arrive at 11am) and set a maximum number of available slots. It's made a really positive impact... we no longer dread busy sessions and customers know they won't have to wait long.",,

The software will count how many packages were sold AND how many tickets within that package were sold. So if I had a package deal of 4 tickets for $X, it would tell me 3 of those packages were sold, with 12 tickets. When you look at total number of tickets sold for the event, it includes the number 3 (for total packages sold) instead of JUST the number of tickets sold.

1900,givesmart,Amazing Product,Brandi G.,Office Manager,,1-2 years,NGC,Capterra,2019-01-09,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,9.0,,"We were looking for an affordable and easy to use mobile bidding auction program and this one did not disappoint. The company sends a representative to the auction to basically be the point person and fix anything that might come up and help with check in, entering data, etc. They show up early and stay through the event. They bring tablets that are easy to use for our volunteers and staff.Entering items and bidders is easy and functional. Your event can go live as soon as you'd like it to so that even donors that can't attend the night of, can bid on items. This increases revenue tremendously. They also helped us with not having small items but focusing on larger items of value and only having around 100-150 silent items. The colorful pictures and descriptions are easy to view on mobile devices. And if guests don't have a smart phone, we can help them bid on our tablets.Guests receive notification of being outbid, but you can add am amount you are willing to pay and Gesture will continue bidding on your behalf until the amount is reached.Guests are also able to check out from their device, so it makes check out a lot faster and smoother.It is a lot easier to collect on balances as well because we collect credit card information before the event.Guests received notification of being outbid, but you can add am amount you are willing to pay and Gesture will continue bidding on your behalf until the amount is reached.","If the tablets go down at check in, it pretty much puts everything at a stand still. Even though the tablets run without wi-fi.","Most of our donors and guests loved the new aspect of our Auction, including switching to mobile bidding/checking in and out. Instead of the previous years of pen and paper bidding. There were only a few people that preferred the old method and just couldn't seem to get on bored. People were concerned that guests would be on their phones all night and no one would be interacting but it was quite the opposite. People had more time to mingle not having to go back and check the paper bid sheets since there were none.",,

It's intuitive and easy to navigate. It makes my job as an event manager much easier. Adding auction items, auction close out, and financial reporting are a breeze. It is also a smooth process for our guests. Bidding on auction items or making a donation is very easy for them, which means more donations for our cause. We set up our auction online in advance of the event. This gives guests an opportunity to start bidding on silent items, and become familiar with live auction items. All of this leads to more revenue to support our mission. I also appreciate the ability to customize our site so it looks like us. This creates a cohesive experience for our guests and helps us put our brand front and center. As a site administrator, I love the ability to download the generated auction sheets. This is a huge time saver. We also download the receipts and send to guests with a thank you letter after the event. It calculates the tax deductibility automatically on the receipt which is an essential feature.","There are a few custom queries/reports I would like which are not currently offered. It can be confusing as an admin to see clearly what funds have been paid and not paid. However, the staff are great and have helped me figure things out. They even created a custom report for me.",,,

Bidders loved how easy it was to register for the silent auction, and we benefitted greatly from launching the website and opening the auction prior to the event. There were many easy tutorials for our volunteers to watch so that they could get comfortable with the online bidding system, and they were well equipped to handle questions from guests. We benefitted greatly from having an onsite specialist with us at the event. She was extremely professional, smart, highly capable and knowledgeable about the software, and she worked nimbly and confidently throughout the night to answer any questions and even offered suggestions that contributed significantly to the success of our auction - and on top of that, she was very enjoyable to be with! After the event, we were able to easily close our books and to process all payments (a significant improvement from many years of dealing with cash and checks and tracking down payments) and to run reports providing incredible data for us to review and learn from.",I cannot think of anything to improve this software. It was perfect for our event - simple to use and very geared toward serving a volunteer-based event!,"Streamlined auction process before, during and after event. We went ""paperless"" and didn't have to fuss with paper bidding forms and associated headaches. We raised more than $10,000 more than we ever raised before using an online bidding system.

Bidders receive texts when they have been outbidded. You are able to create endless silent and live auction items for your page. Event support is so responsive and you are able to customize your support needs for in state and out of state events. Their team arrive to your event with ipads to complete donor bidder profiles on site. They will come to your booth in exhibit hall and encourage people to register for bidding. They are super friendly and outgoing and are great as live auction spotters. They raise far more than their cost and double our giving. You are able to even enter in different pledge amounts as donation items on the auction site.,"They are a little costly however it's worth it for a smooth, successful event. I do wish the website was a little more attractive and grouped the silent and live items together. The items appear kind of small and cramped together.",GiveSmart provides much needed day of event support as well as an easy to use interface for auction bidding. Reporting has helped ease the closeout process and assure everyone receives their items and we receive payment. They send continuous follow-up to donors for payment post event.

Features offered have improved each year we have contracted with Givesmart. ""One stop shopping"" for event and auction management. We have utilized more features each year. What started as just utilizing auction management capability with limited effort into making the online auction site attractive has evolved to guest ticketing, table assignments, a highly customized auction site that reflects the event theme and with real time auction progress and bids scrolling on large screen ad televisions throughout the event venue to increase people's competitive bidding nature. After action information has been vital to determining what auction items had the most interests and highest profit margin. Has enabled us to better focus solicitation efforts for the next year.",Really very few cons for the software.

I thoroughly appreciate Gesture's frequent software updates. They are continuously in search of even better ways to improve upon the customer experience, which they communicate through their Gesture Innovation Center emails. I believe that they value customer opinions and implement suggestions, accordingly. As an event planner, other companies often approach me, but none offer the experience Gesture has given my clients over the years. Our account manager, Allie Erickson is on top of our every need, patient, accessible, friendly and helpful. Our on-site manager is thoughtful, communicative, professional and kind. The Gesture team is trustworthy, diligent and fully dedicated to their customers. Every year, our attendees highly rate Gesture in our post-event survey.

The transition from paper building to mobile has drastically increased our pre-event and day of event fundraising. My favorite part about the software is the increase in funds collected the night of the event. It was incredibly unfortunately how much staff time we had to dedicate post event to collecting money, for many of our events we not have 100% funds collected the night of the event, which frees our staff up to focus on thanking donors. Lastly, the interface is very easy to understand and navigate. We have a number of events that have more mature attendees, who were skeptical when we began to make the transition from paper to electronic. After one use they all required we use the technology at future events. This is also a credit to the Gesture onsite staff who really meet the attendees where they are at and give extra attention when needed!","I guess my comments would be both a pro and a con. The fact that Gesture is constantly evolving and improving the technology it can sometimes be hard to keep up with all of the current offerings and capabilities as a client. This is one of many vendors you work with so it can be hard to keep yourself educated. Although, this is when you really rely on your account manager to relay this information to you, which our, representtaive, does a wonderful job.",,,

I also really like the ease in which bidders can participate, get alerts, and have knowledge of their purchases. Finally, the added bonus of a PR team to work with was an extra perk I was not expecting!","There are certain gaps in the software we have discovered such as: Nowhere to record solicitors such as staff, committee, or Board member who was responsible for bringing in the item; Nowhere to record an individual's name associated with a company in donor details; Nowhere to record details for pledged item, such as when it will be delivered, staff pick-up needs, etc.; Need to have ability to check box if donor has already received thank you for their contributions (such as when it went unsold at a past event and is being used again); Non-transferrable input from one event to another such as donor information. I also have major concerns over the software abilities to capture donations during the ask. There is simply no way to ensure those that raise their hands, are actually hitting the button to donate that is texted to them.","During this first year in using the software, I saw the additional benefit of securing bids in advance of opening the auction. This started us out thousands of dollars ahead of where we would have traditionally began at the event.",,

I am new to the website and it only took me about an hour to figure everything out. Everything is pretty self explanatory. I had to create an auction site for a silent and live auction. Adding each item came with ease. When you go to add an item each section is categorized telling you exactly what information to put in. I also found it very easy to go back and change things if I had made a mistake. The site is easy for others to use and view the auction items I posted. I felt that the crowd we were trying to attract was the older generation of people and this site allowed them to have the ability to see each item without complication. I really liked that the software told you who was watching certain items. It was easy to generate an item sheet in order to print them out and post them for our auction.,I think my least favorite thing about this software is trying to figure out when someone bids higher than you and who it is. I found that I had trouble when I bid on an item. My friend and I really wanted an item and we kept out bidding each other but didn't realize we were the only two bidding. I wish it would tell you who is bidding against yo.,I had a wonderful experience with this software. I found it was easy to make my own auction site.,,

It's a fantastic tool for mobile bidding at auctions and overall ""day-of-event"" fundraising. Easy to use and navigate. In addition to the software, you get actual people that run the software the day of the event.","One challenge I have found is that the information from last year's event doesn't carry over to the next year. Since we typically get a lot of the same donors, I have to re-enter donors from scratch instead of having the system ""remember"" them from last year.","Good overall experience, we will use them again next year.

The spreadsheets can be sorted as you like for your purposes. I also like the messaging. You can send out text messages to your guests for reminders like auction open for bidding, parking, auction closing, links to photos post event, etc. You can also generate tax letters from the site. A lot of great features!","The only thing I wish it could do is generate tax letters for each guest separately. If you need to make a change for one guest, you have to generate all letters as they go into a single PDF file. You can't just generate them for one guest. Not a major problem, just wish it was a feature. Overall it is a great system!","I have been able to generate reports that I need for sharing with my committee and for tax letters.

We used it for check in and the process was simple and easy to understand for our volunteers at registration to find info. We used it for our silent auction and guests were able to see the items from their phones and bid very easily and they received notices when they were outbid or when they won. We used it for general donations, selling centerpieces, and checkout. Overall pretty easy to use during the event.","During the check in process we were unable to search by table number which would have been helpful because sometimes we are asked who is sitting at a certain table and it would be nice to look up by table. Also after the event we needed specific reports to be able to input all of the money we received and record all of the info and gestures did not yet have one comprehensive report to give us what we needed, instead I had to modify and combine several reports to make it work for our needs.",,,

Ad-hoc shows, especially, require that you set up a completely new event, including reminder emails, ticket setup, etc. even if that info doesn't change from show to show.","The system is reliable and solid in what it does.

Overall, I think it's a great ticketing / subscription / member software for the price and staff support. We researched five other CRM systems this fall and ended up sticking with VBO. I would highly suggest a demo with the company to see if it fits into what you need. And if you're not sure, they seem willing to customize the process so it works for you.

It has allowed us to move our service up another level, and to rely less on one person (me) so that I can envision passing the ticketing/membership function on to someone else. The only suggestion I would make is that structure is needed in the overall training program. I am now at the point where I am wrestling with reconciling sales in VBO/Stripe/my bank account/chart of accounts and it is very difficult and non-uniform. Key information that I need (what was purchased - a subscription or tickets, and tickets to what event) are not passed over into Stripe, so I have to do a cumber reconcile process in order to allocate a deposit among the various bookkeeping accounts.

Very easy to track and manage ticket sales and registration lists.","We used EventBank with an umbrella page for a complex series of 11 events in 8 days and 8 different venues. The complexity tested the limits of the software in terms of flexibility and customization. Not possible to show more than one venue. Also, not possible to link iCalendar to specific event but only to entire 8 days nor to disable this function. However, this degree of complexity is certainly an exception for events managed by EventBank software.",We didn't use it as Membership Management Software,,

The company sends a representative to the auction to basically be the point person and fix anything that might come up and help with check in, entering data, etc. They show up early and stay through the event. They bring tablets that are easy to use for our volunteers and staff.Entering items and bidders is easy and functional. Your event can go live as soon as you'd like it to so that even donors that can't attend the night of, can bid on items. This increases revenue tremendously. They also helped us with not having small items but focusing on larger items of value and only having around 100-150 silent items. The colorful pictures and descriptions are easy to view on mobile devices. And if guests don't have a smart phone, we can help them bid on our tablets.Guests receive notification of being outbid, but you can add am amount you are willing to pay and Gesture will continue bidding on your behalf until the amount is reached.Guests are also able to check out from their device, so it makes check out a lot faster and smoother.It is a lot easier to collect on balances as well because we collect credit card information before the event.Guests received notification of being outbid, but you can add am amount you are willing to pay and Gesture will continue bidding on your behalf until the amount is reached.","If the tablets go down at check in, it pretty much puts everything at a stand still. Even though the tablets run without wi-fi.","Most of our donors and guests loved the new aspect of our Auction, including switching to mobile bidding/checking in and out. Instead of the previous years of pen and paper bidding. There were only a few people that preferred the old method and just couldn't seem to get on bored. People were concerned that guests would be on their phones all night and no one would be interacting but it was quite the opposite. People had more time to mingle not having to go back and check the paper bid sheets since there were none.",,

It's intuitive and easy to navigate. It makes my job as an event manager much easier. Adding auction items, auction close out, and financial reporting are a breeze. It is also a smooth process for our guests. Bidding on auction items or making a donation is very easy for them, which means more donations for our cause. We set up our auction online in advance of the event. This gives guests an opportunity to start bidding on silent items, and become familiar with live auction items. All of this leads to more revenue to support our mission. I also appreciate the ability to customize our site so it looks like us. This creates a cohesive experience for our guests and helps us put our brand front and center. As a site administrator, I love the ability to download the generated auction sheets. This is a huge time saver. We also download the receipts and send to guests with a thank you letter after the event. It calculates the tax deductibility automatically on the receipt which is an essential feature.","There are a few custom queries/reports I would like which are not currently offered.

The transition from paper building to mobile has drastically increased our pre-event and day of event fundraising. My favorite part about the software is the increase in funds collected the night of the event. It was incredibly unfortunately how much staff time we had to dedicate post event to collecting money, for many of our events we not have 100% funds collected the night of the event, which frees our staff up to focus on thanking donors. Lastly, the interface is very easy to understand and navigate. We have a number of events that have more mature attendees, who were skeptical when we began to make the transition from paper to electronic. After one use they all required we use the technology at future events. This is also a credit to the Gesture onsite staff who really meet the attendees where they are at and give extra attention when needed!","I guess my comments would be both a pro and a con. The fact that Gesture is constantly evolving and improving the technology it can sometimes be hard to keep up with all of the current offerings and capabilities as a client.

Finally, the added bonus of a PR team to work with was an extra perk I was not expecting!","There are certain gaps in the software we have discovered such as: Nowhere to record solicitors such as staff, committee, or Board member who was responsible for bringing in the item; Nowhere to record an individual's name associated with a company in donor details; Nowhere to record details for pledged item, such as when it will be delivered, staff pick-up needs, etc.; Need to have ability to check box if donor has already received thank you for their contributions (such as when it went unsold at a past event and is being used again); Non-transferrable input from one event to another such as donor information. I also have major concerns over the software abilities to capture donations during the ask. There is simply no way to ensure those that raise their hands, are actually hitting the button to donate that is texted to them.","During this first year in using the software, I saw the additional benefit of securing bids in advance of opening the auction. This started us out thousands of dollars ahead of where we would have traditionally began at the event.",,

I am new to the website and it only took me about an hour to figure everything out. Everything is pretty self explanatory. I had to create an auction site for a silent and live auction. Adding each item came with ease. When you go to add an item each section is categorized telling you exactly what information to put in. I also found it very easy to go back and change things if I had made a mistake. The site is easy for others to use and view the auction items I posted. I felt that the crowd we were trying to attract was the older generation of people and this site allowed them to have the ability to see each item without complication. I really liked that the software told you who was watching certain items. It was easy to generate an item sheet in order to print them out and post them for our auction.,I think my least favorite thing about this software is trying to figure out when someone bids higher than you and who it is. I found that I had trouble when I bid on an item. My friend and I really wanted an item and we kept out bidding each other but didn't realize we were the only two bidding. I wish it would tell you who is bidding against yo.,I had a wonderful experience with this software. I found it was easy to make my own auction site.,,

It's a fantastic tool for mobile bidding at auctions and overall ""day-of-event"" fundraising. Easy to use and navigate. In addition to the software, you get actual people that run the software the day of the event.","One challenge I have found is that the information from last year's event doesn't carry over to the next year. Since we typically get a lot of the same donors, I have to re-enter donors from scratch instead of having the system ""remember"" them from last year.","Good overall experience, we will use them again next year. Custom service for the software is very responsive. Most of the people they send to the event are very polite and professional, but we have had a couple of people that have not been the best at representing our organization.",,

The spreadsheets can be sorted as you like for your purposes. I also like the messaging. You can send out text messages to your guests for reminders like auction open for bidding, parking, auction closing, links to photos post event, etc. You can also generate tax letters from the site. A lot of great features!","The only thing I wish it could do is generate tax letters for each guest separately. If you need to make a change for one guest, you have to generate all letters as they go into a single PDF file. You can't just generate them for one guest. Not a major problem, just wish it was a feature. Overall it is a great system!","I have been able to generate reports that I need for sharing with my committee and for tax letters.

The staff from gestures that helped during the event was knowledgeable and able to help and respond quickly and effectively during the event went on which made it less chaotic feeling for us.","I love that gesture was easy for our guests to use at our gala. We used it for check in and the process was simple and easy to understand for our volunteers at registration to find info. We used it for our silent auction and guests were able to see the items from their phones and bid very easily and they received notices when they were outbid or when they won. We used it for general donations, selling centerpieces, and checkout. Overall pretty easy to use during the event.","During the check in process we were unable to search by table number which would have been helpful because sometimes we are asked who is sitting at a certain table and it would be nice to look up by table. Also after the event we needed specific reports to be able to input all of the money we received and record all of the info and gestures did not yet have one comprehensive report to give us what we needed, instead I had to modify and combine several reports to make it work for our needs.",,,

For us, we were using three different systems that were not compatible--they were antiquated and clumsy. Spektrix is key in bringing everything to one place. The great part about this software is that it is cloud-based. I can access Spektrix from my phone, tablet, computer at home or a coffee shop or, of course, at the workplace. I've placed ticket orders for people while out on the town and worked through patron data from my couch at home.","There is not necessarily an overarching dislike of Spektrix. The nice element of the software is that the company behind it is always taking client feedback and making changes to better accommodate their needs. A few challenges we have had in the past include the inability to have an easy way to sell general admission series tickets. There is a fixed seating/fixed series option, but you have to find a loophole for GA series. Additionally, we've done outdoor festival ticketing in the past two years--while the cloud-based system is great, it does require you to have access to internet. It would be great to see a version of the software that you can download and temporarily run off-line if you are ticketing in the middle of a closed-down road for a festival with no wifi nearby that is strong enough to power the system. I don't know if it is possible, but something to think about :)","There is so much that Spektrix has to offer. We chose Spektrix to solve a few problems--getting our database and patron transactions in one place, control over ticket prices and fees that add up when using third party ticket companies and the ability to collect data on patrons which helps us further engage our community. We've been thrilled about our experience with the company so far--they are diligent with customer service and help work through challenges that their clients are facing even when it reaches further than ticketing/fundraising.",,

The sales interface at the box office is straightforward and volunteers comfortable with computers can be trained quickly. The web interface is customizable if you have a good developer on your team-keeping the customer on our website rather than going off to a ticket vendor was very important to us and Spektrix enables us to achieve this objective.

By offering ticketing services to area not-for-profit organizations and to the school corporation for plays, we are able to offset some of the fixed monthly fees for use of the Spektrix system.","The administrative end requires significant training time. Adding events is generally straightforward, but there is no way to save instances that are in draft form without having all of the seating, pricing, and price lists all completed beforehand-an autosave feature would be nice!

All functions are controlled internally. The software allows for online ticketing with a very professional appearance. It eliminates the need for other related software i.e. funds development and volunteer coordination.,"- Many of the more advance features takes a lot of training.

- 64bit windows needs work to improve work flow

- Requires robust computers for good performance","We have been using TM since 2002. It was a big investment for us at that time. However, it was also one of the most affordable options and immediately improved our functionality . The TM team is great at assessing your needs and giving you what you need and not over selling you. We eventually grew and TM was able to grow with us. The system allows for one stop shopping for ticketing, funds development, facilities management and volunteer coordination. I have yet to find a function from other high priced box office systems that TM cannot provide.

TM support is friendly, knowledgable and helpful. Typically, they respond within the hour and can get you fixed up promptly. One drawback is night and weekend support is not part of the standard support package. That being said, I have only needed support a handful of times on weekends since 2002.

One of the best features of TM is the ability to sell tickets online via your website without a third party. This eliminates high ticketing fees to outside vendors. Any fees charged stays with the venue. This is a great way to fund your ticketing system investment.

Training for employees is relatively easy. A few hours of training will allow a person to process basic ticket orders. Additional functions such as donations, season subscriptions and gift certificate sales might take additional time. Typically they are learned on the job.

Some specialized functions needed to sell package tickets or other non typical functions online will require a plug in. Plug ins are paid for separately and scheduled in advance through IT.

Another great feature is the ability to provide box office services to other organizations within your community or in different spaces. TM allows for multiple venues and seating configurations and pricing options. This can also provide additional revenue streams to your organization.

Artsman is a small and well run company. You have direct access to all levels of management and ownership. They are very sensitive to your needs and feedback and often respond in very positive ways. I have made comments or suggestions that eventually make their way into a future updates. I highly recommend this company and product.","Over all I can't see myself using any other software.

There is nothing we've asked of TM that it cannot do, or that their developers haven't been able to make happen. Theatre software is difficult and complex, and usually not very intuitive. In that sense, this is the same! But once you learn how to do what you need to, there is not a better value out there.","Anything I've not liked over the years (mobile access, slow load times, etc) has all been corrected in future development. I've not liked that I cannot export, as a file, multiple phone numbers which is a holdover from landline days. But I expect that will be fixed shortly.","We are a regional theatre with a 900+ seat house, and multiple weeks of sales for multiple productions.

I have used it at two different organizations, and it has served our needs nicely. The support team is responsive and helpful. Like most software, you get out of it what you put in. If your staff are willing to learn the system and get excited about all the ways it can help, then it's wonderful! If you have a staff who don't like to learn new things and aren't inquisitive about ""I wonder how I find this information or use this to help me do x, y, and z"", then you will not be getting your money's worth. It can do almost everything you need a CRM database to do, but you have to be willing to put the training and time in to take full advantage of its features. It's intuitive for those who are tech-savvy and see the value of multi-dimensional data (I fall into that group), but may not be valued by those who aren't quick to adapt to new technology (some of my colleagues fall into this group). I highly recommend this product for organizations that are interested in data and using technology to help them do their work better and more efficiently. Even if you use it only to sell tickets (though it does SO MUCH MORE), it is likely a step up from any third party vendors you are currently using (it definitely was for us).","Over all I can't see myself using any other software.

2275,ticket_tailor,Ticket Tailor are an extremely stable online management system for selling event tickets,Gareth S.,Marketing and Event Manager,,2+ years,NO,Capterra,2018-02-25,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Their system can be used as stand-alone and/or integrates fully with your website and social media customer touch points.Set up of your own box office is relatively easy, but it easier still if you spend time writing all or marketing information and promotional pictures before you log in. Then have everything ready to copy and paste and upload the images. However, you can save your event pages as drafts to return to later, or update at any time.You can set up different methods of payment to suit your requirements and can design the interface to match your brand.Once set up your box office becomes fully automated, so you can check in to your dash board as frequently or infrequently as you wish and check sales and data as you wish.They have an app you can download to your smartphone to be used for checking in, which saves on buying or hiring in barcode scanners and gives great data and feedback on attendance for future events.","As a small event's organiser, there is not a lot we dislike. The only modification I would like to see is to the monthly payment plan.It jumps from one event payment plan to 5 events. Maybe they could introduce a 2 - 3 event plan?","Selling and monitoring of event ticket sales can be managed through your website and social media sites and becomes fully automated. It gives you an online booking office and enables the booking procedure UX to be easy to complete and payment can be secure through systems like PayPal. It automatically sends the customer the e-ticket and records their information for you to access at any time, along with sales data that can be invaluable for marketing and setting up other events.You only pay per event or within a selected number of events depending on your payment plan. You pay monthly for the period of sales you want and can stop it at any time.",,

Back then it was ""only"" an in-memory DB. With each new SPS release, HANA became better with more DB features integrated. Fast forward to today, it is a full-fledged database platform with enterprise features that rival (and in some cases) even bests Oracle, MSSQL, DB2, et al. For customers who intend to use SAP for the foreseeable future, you would no doubt have HANA already as part of your existing if not future SAP roadmap, given that support for the traditional DBs is until 2025.SAP HANA, which is re-written from the ground up to fully take advantage of today's modern hardware, supports multi-threaded CPU architecture, use of terabytes of memory to run its in-memory database capabilities, columnar & row based database with full-fledged compression, full support of PL-SQL and many other application components.From a hardware perspective it is a 2-horse race with the commodity Intel x86 platforms becoming more powerful with each CPU iteration and better CPU core-to-memory ratio support, and IBM with their Power-based CPU architecture. As hardware prices continue to fall and become more powerful, it is only a matter of time before HANA hardware becomes truly commoditised.","Today SAP HANA is not only a competent database platform, but also is a very robust applications platform. As HANA continues to grow its feature set naturally there are more bugs as a result of a multitude of features. Development of SAP HANA is also diversified across multiple locations around the globe (Walldorf, India, etc.). SAP must do a better job in responding quicker to customers with issues.","Must-use for all SAP customers, given that it is critical to SAP's success as an enterprise software company.",,
2457,,All in one & easy,Leah P.,DB Admin,,2+ years,NO,Software Advice,2017-11-07,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,10.0,"For an all in one suite ERP, this is the best. Although some areas are not quite as robust as some would like, SAP really nailed it with this one. They address a huge span of customers with the one product, which is completely customizable if you want to spend the money. However, most of the time, companies find that they can walk with the product, no customizations for the first 6mos. Then they get a good feel for what they want to change.","SAP took all of the knowledge gained with ECC, B1, etc. & published it into this cloud solution. You buy the license, and you have access to all modules. It is not a new charge to add in Project Management for example. You just turn it on. Online help documents are outstanding, and you can literally learn the entire software functionality by following them. With it being a cloud solution, you get auto updates every 3mo, which is nice. It updates some of the default government fees, for all of the countries you have in your system. Expense reporting for example. There is very little administration needed to let the software flow once you turn it on. And the best part is that you just need internet to access the software.","It is for mid-size businesses. So for larger organizations, the licensing can get pricey. There is a limited amount of knowledge in the field on the product, so it can take some time to get answers for some topics from the partners, or to find info online.",,,
2458,,Everything is done for you!,Leah P.,DB Admin,,Less than 6 months,NO,Software Advice,2016-11-15,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,10.0,"I have been working with this product for almost 2 years now. Most of my knowledge is self-taught from the online documents. This system is as robust as you wish it to be. The thinking has been done. Language packs, which apply in all modules, Country-specific financial rules that are updated constantly (IRS Guidelines for Expense Reporting for example), auto calculations, multi-currency use within one transaction. A counter part in Germany can operate in German, while all of mine can be in English when I am troubleshooting their issues, I think is outstanding. SAP is constantly updating, they have a great team backing the product, it is very personable user experience in my opinion. We use it for Order to Cash. We use the Supply Chain set up, full Financials. Production of Materials, Purchasing, Customer Service, just not POS. Although it has the ability, our business does not operate that way.","The process is built in, it is native to the operation of the system. SAP's been in the business long enough to be able to take all of the success from Enterprise ERP applications that they have built, and merge this into an online application. The product is very versatile for what I would think many styles of business. I personally enjoy the idea of not having to program the system to react a specific way, I work through the process in a test, using the online documentation, some time with an SAP Partner (Consulting Company), but the hours spent there are little. We also have the additional SDK, so we can write some personalization to the product if we wish to. The SAP Support tools are wonderful, there is probably too many resources to reach out to.",Not available in HTML in the production environments yet. Some users have been testing out the HTML in the test tenants. It is completely different layout. We would love to be able to drag & drop attachments instead of having to browse to them.,,"I personally would recommend this product to anyone looking to upgrade or start out with an ERP / MRP. This tool is very robust, you can bring on one module at a time, and all different implementation partners know what they are doing, as SAP validates their abilities first. This is a very well-thought out product.",

Properties like faster data fetching, quick execution times, speedy access to external Apps make it a very useful technology. The business problems being solved with the product are as the data volume grows, the conventional database based reports and processes tend to slow down. This at times negatively affects the year on year trend analysis and processes requiring multiple data fetch. HANA, being in memory database virtually eliminates these issues. The data fetch is almost instantaneous and the processes run much faster.",I see nothing negative about the technology in itself. The roll out of this platform could have been done in a better way. The cloud integration of SAP has been slow as well. These I thing that can be looked into,"I what find is that since SAP is firmly sticking with in memory computing and making all of their processes compatible with in-memory computing. This eventually forces customers to migrate to HANA but the user experience in HANA is much better compared to the alternate in my opinion. This is recommended for any SAP customer with large volumes of data that needs processing, reporting and analysis. I would recommend with training",,

This is due to the in-memory technology incorporated into the system.2. Very easy to set up and integration with SAP is almost flawless. This is especially true with cloud.3. The user interface is not only eye catching, it also incorporates analytics which enable the users to create interactive dashboards, graphs and widgets.4. Since it is a database in itself, which supports data to be stored in columns (as opposed to the previously used MS SQL, which stores in rows), it allows for faster data processing, analytics and more efficient storage of data.5. It allows a company to monitor key KPIs.6. In terms of security, it is very efficient. It relies on encryption, patching and best practices when it comes to security. It is also linux-based which provides a very secure platform","1. The hardware and software specifications required to run HANA may be unavailable to some businesses hence if a company wants to use it, the would have to acquire them.2. The dashboards and some of the analytical features are unavailable on mobile.3. While customizing and writing stored procedures, one must be very careful as the application is linux-based hence it is case sensitive.","It is very reliable, fast and efficient.

Before this concept of in-memory computing and memory storage (without reading the disk all the time), some reports took very long to load. Now you can get access to a larger piece of data in seconds. HANA also brings BW to another level of real time reporting, even detailed information can be shown in no time, its very fast. The way we build views by using the HANA Modeler is very simple but yet powerful, you can do a lot with little knowledge and much more with some expertise.","The tools used to work with HANA are both the HANA Studio or Eclipse with SAP HANA plugins. In my opinion, it could be better than it is; with more components, less bugs (you have to restart the environment every once in a while) and a better explanation about how the aggregation you see has been formed (Simpler than PlanViz).","With SAP HANA, my skills in view calculations have increased, I have another point of view about how to create one type of report or another. It is also very productive and very fast response.

+ simple with lots of features

+ perfectly flexible and adjustable for the different needs

+ very helpful and qualified staff

+ nice people to work with

+ amazingly quick responses on our requests

+ very personal work relationship",We have not experienced any yet.,"We had been investigating new ticketing systems for quite a while, and 168tickets was one of the companies we took a closer look at.

The reasons we chose their product were because their offer was kept simple, easy to understand and very inexpensive.

What they offer is great and fits our needs perfectly: from single tickets to full season passes with different pricing per event, ticket printing at home and other features which will help our office staff tremendously. What absolutely convinced me was their incredibly short response time to our requests during the set-up period, and how helpful they were in assisting us to get everything up and running. I don't think any other company could have done any better, so I highly recommend 168tickets from our experience so far.

It was the first time we had used an online ticketing system for these events (normally the several hundred tickets would only be sold in the playground) and we saw an increase in the take up of tickets almost immediately. This I think was partly due to being able to send around general links and share the event on facebook (reaching a bigger audience) and also the ability for people to pay online securely. We will now use BookitBee for all PTA events and as a result for many other community events and would highly recommend it.,"Easy to use, flexible, low cost",None,"I have used Bookitbee for about a year now and they have been brilliant.

With a lot of amazing help from friends our events were successful. I credit thundertix with the ease of getting information to supporters.

We were very hesitant at first, but with multiple calls to Pam initially and very frequently later, we are smooth sailing.She only showed concern and kindness when we called. This is so needed in our world today. I would recommend this to anyone who is selling tickets to an event.The availability to contact your donors is at your fingertips. We decided to email tickets to customers 2 weeks before our event. We send an email right away, to let them know we have received their sponsorship, thank them for it and let them know when to expect their tickets. It makes it so easy for everyone. The supporters and in our case, our volunteers.I spent many hours looking at different options and I know we made the right choice.The customer service from Pam is more than it's weight in gold. I am not kidding, she could help with every issue. This is only our 3rd year to use the software, in this time period, there have been several ""upgrades"".One other thing that made it really nice for us, especially as beginners, is the compatibility between thundertix and our credit card payment system. They worked it out behind the scenes where any credit card information is not on my website. When a customer hits the sponsorship or donate tab, they are immediately taken to another website where this information is taken on a much more encrypted safe site than mine.In 2 years we have given back $265,000.00 to our community.

2739,thundertix,ThunderTix continually provides outstanding service!,Alecia O.,,,,NO,Capterra,2016-09-08,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"I was lucky enough to have found ThunderTix when I worked for The Cider Mill Playhouse in Endicott, New York, almost ten years ago. Stacy Chapman helped me learn the system and how to easily customize it for our oddly shaped (half circle thrust) theater. Our older, not-so-computer-savvy customers found it to be extremely user friendly and it really streamlined the box office experience too! Two years ago I became the Marketing Director for the Chenango Arts Council in Norwich, New York, whose ticketing system was really in need of updating. I suggested we look into ThunderTix, recalling the positive experience I had in the past. Stacy Chapman was still with the company and had gotten a well deserved promotion, but she remembered me from the Cider Mill! And I remembered her of course, because she was so helpful and proactive. The ThunderTix system proved to be exactly what we needed. Stacy once again held my hand through the set-up process, even though it wasn't really her job anymore. Pam Mason has also been extremely helpful, and our audience feedback reveals their experience just gets more and more enjoyable. What prompts me to write this is the almost uncanny ability ThunderTix has in predicting what I'm going to need next. The old seat blocking function allowed me to block our season subscribers' favorite seats so we could go online to the general public for ticket sales earlier than usual, which was great! But I faced the laborious old unblocking system which I knew would be time consuming. Lo and behold on September 1st, I can unblock seats with just a click!!! So happy! How did ThunderTix know? Just another example of listening to their clients and being proactively thinking ahead! I will always highly recommend ThunderTix to anyone looking for a straightforward, user-friendly, customer friendly, intuitive ticketing system, and I truly appreciate all the time and effort Stacy, Pam, and all the staff and programmers obviously put into their jobs. Well done, and THANK YOU!",,,,,

I tested several vendors. We wanted to control what our patrons paid (if anything) to purchase tickets. So many vendor's pass on these high costs to the patrons to pay for the service. But Thundertix allows us to set the costs we might choose to pass on to our patrons. Not to mention that the cost of implementation was very reasonable and almost painless. They worked with us to customize and integrate their site to maintain the same look and feel of ours. Most of our patrons have no idea they're even on a third party site when buying tickets. Now they're taking things to the next level and integrating even more tools into their system that people use every day (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, YouTube and MySpace). They're always working to enhance their system. Their response to issues is like lightening. So the thunderbolt logo is very appropriate.",I honestly cannot think of any cons.

It was VERY easy to scan tickets with the app as well.,"It's not as intuitive. Finding out where to click to sell tickets, to design tickets, how to make them look the way we needed them to look...it actually required note-taking that I could refer to because things weren't in the obvious places to look. But once that was learned, it became easy to make the software do what we needed. I feel like part of it might actually be the web design as opposed to the software...for example, there are two rows of tabs. The top row is supposed to be related to your account, and the second row to your specific event. It doesn't SAY that anywhere, and I think there are exceptions, but we had to figure it out. (Notice that I'm still not sure about that, and I've been the one primarily working on the event.) I feel like someone on the phone would have figured that out right away and told us and saved us a couple of hours of clicking, but finding a phone number is next to impossible. Email is responsive, though, so it's not like they leave you completely in the dark. It's just not convenient.","I'm not sure that we did.

Integration with payment gateway and email service was trivial.Web interface is modern and clean.

Our company switched to a different ticketing system for almost a year. The reason for the switch was primarily cost driven. The rival service advertised similar features but the reality was far from what was advertised. The customer service was nonexistent with the other company.

All inclusive package options at price points we can pick. Customer service was reliable and we always had all our questions answered - if an answer was unavailable then our rep made sure to find a solution we could work with. Inexpensive and extremely competitive. We have used other software from competing vendors and honestly would recommend PurplePass before recommending other software. Lots of great programming options based on our individual needs and not so overly complicated that we need an IT degree to manipulate the software - that is the bonus! Our rep, Gabriel, was great to work with and responsive to our sometimes wacky questions.","We really liked the software as it is very competitive to other programs available on the market. The only two drawbacks we found include integration onto websites - it doesn't allow the user to stay on the website - it kept forwarding to PurplePass url. Perhaps this is due to our website software - WIX- but that was slightly annoying for our users. The other drawback is really more of a suggestion - while the software is easy to use and the search functions are great - there was not enough promotions by PurplePass for the events listed. It would be great to have a calendar of upcoming events promoted through social media or on the site itself - we found we had to ""search"" for our event and thought it would be a better selling point for PurplePass to offer ""promotions"" on the site and suggested events. Target market on social media for example.","Easy to use, functionality, competitive price, friendly and responsive reps.",,

I like there is an option to do a seating chart and assigned seating. Also being able to make our event personalized on purplepass.,"The app felt limited. If we wanted to scan we could only be on the ""scanning mode"", if we had a walk-in attendee that needed to purchase a ticket we had to remember to change modes.

It worked fine at the beginning, but we started having many problems with it and it couldn't handle our ticketing load. So we started researching alternative ticketing solutions to implement. We tested around 10 different systems to determine what would work best for us. In the end, we chose Purplepass. Purplepass had the most features, was the easiest to implement, and was the lowest cost to operate. Whenever we had questions, Purplepass was always quick to respond and help us get the support we needed. We have been very happy using Purplepass.

There are a lot of features that I could access without issue on the website, that I could not access on the app. For the purposes of simplified scanning/ticket taking and will call checking, the app was amazing - but it would have been nice to have more depth to what I could access","This was the first event that we have held where we have utilized PurplePass for our needs. From start to finish, it has been so easy to have a smooth event. The representative we spoke with was AMAZING and made the new information so simple. The tickets that we received for our event were STUNNING and having the ability to just scan them allowed for our guests to have a nice keepsake ticket.

Their interface to select seats simple stood out among the rest, and it super easy to configure. Our's was a special use case though, because we are membership based society which has several grades of membership. People already become members and are then given a choice of seats in their allocated zone. When we contacted Purplepass and told them our requirements, they responded back saying that it was a too complicated for their current system and that it will require them to change their internal engine to support this need. We however were very interested to go forward with this idea. At our end we created some web-services to access our data and made it available to Purplepass. Then we wrote a full requirement specification for Purplepass to implement. They started on the project a few weeks before the event and in one week or so, they had a prototype ready for us using our specification. We did some testing to make sure it met our needs, and went through a few more iterations perfecting it to an acceptable level. Note that this was done under a severe time crunch and Purplepass were very prompt in delivering our needs. We did launch a week before the event date and everyone was thrilled with the interface. As a bonus the interface also allowed the ability for members to re-allocate their seats after they have already selected their seats once. We also got thermal-printer tickets printed for the entire hall and rented scanners for box-office use. This was super easy to use. Overall I was very pleased with the experience and will use it going forward when we have big events like these.",,,,,

The ambiance required to get my audience on-board with each of my immersive experiences begins with the ticket links and it is both a satisfying and refreshing to know this is available and reliable on Purplepass.","The learning curve for the more advance options was overwhelming at first and there are sometimes setbacks when paying the listing prices back to the company but both are easily fixed and overlooked.The lack integration with platforms such as Facebook is irritating at times as tickets cannot be listed as readily on a Facebook event or boosted post but, with some creativity and patience this, too, can be overcome.",Overall its been stellar.

Gabe of Purple Pass made those adjustments immediately and kept us purring right along. We had 4 cashiers to handle the cash transactions. We had 4 shifts during the 2 days with 4 cashiers and 2-4 scanners. They were all volunteers. The touchscreens and software was intuitive and training for each shift was quick and painless. Around half of our ticket sales were on line. Those guests only had to be scanned. In the future we will need less cashiers. We had some issues with QR codes which were poorly printed and some folks who printed the receipt and not the ticket. Some folks had tickets on their smart phones and the screens were hard to read with the scanners.Gabe was right there and immediately solved those problems and kept the guests happy. The stats which were available any time for the asking were invaluable during the event and planning for our next one. This was our 2nd year with Purple Pass. Last year the system was good but we had problems with the broadband service and credit card processing. Not a Purple Pass caused problem. The software, the touch screens and scanner were all better than last year. They keep getting better and better.

They have the key attributes of a successful enterprise. We look for relationships with people who have the Capacity and the Integrity to operate in this competitive Creative world of ours. Often times you find folks who have the Capacity (able and experienced in their craft) but, may not be totally trustworthy. On the other hand, people with the Integrity (honest with a great work ethic) may not have the knowledge and experience to perform at the levels our industry requires. So, it is refreshing to find people and Teams that exhibit both characteristics.

3079,rezware xp7,Tour Reservation & Food Sales System,Kim G.,Interactive Manager,,,,Capterra,2010-03-12,4,4.0,,5.0,,,,"Rezware is an affordable system that was able to be customized to meet our unique needs. When doing our research, it was the only system that allowed for this customization while having a base to start from that understands our business type. The system we were looking for had to accomodate reservations for two types of daily tours running on an hourly basis. We were also able to incorporate our food and drink sales into the system which was a requirement. The reporting gives us various ways to look at our data which we found has been a real need. And, while the system took a while for everyone to get comfortable with, we now find that it is quite easy to use. There are lots of shortcuts and helpful tools within it as well. And, having the training mode that uses real data is another very useful tool. Finally, the people at Rezware have been very responsive to our questions and providing support whenever needed.","Due to the customization of our system, the implementation took longer than anticipated. And, we have run into some glitches that probably wouldn't have happened if we used the system as is. But, the technology and customer support team at Rezware went above and beyond to remedy any situations that occured. There is not enough written documentation on the system so we had to develop our own reference manual. Our training sessions and calls with Rezware have always been helpful and has allowed us to map out how to use the system for our needs.","Rezware is a solid system that we expect to be using for a long time. And, we look forward to growing into the system more by using the additional features that are available. The customization has been essential to the requirements of our business. And, the support on the system has been very responsive and understanding of our needs.",,

The RezWeb Online module was easy to implement and the RezWeb programmers did a good job integrating with our web site graphics.",Our biggest challenge has been our own learning curve in understanding the impact of some of the custom programming changes we have requested of RezWare. We would have been better off to learn the system first and then decide what we wanted changed.,"My recommendation is that you first map your current requirements against the RezWare system. You need to understand what drives the data for your management reports and how the data flows through the system.

3086,silent_auction_pro,Great Support and good for small non profit,Jennifer H.,Event Chair,,1-2 years,NO,Capterra,2019-04-18,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,,"This is great software for silent auctions and generally a good value for a small non profit. They have amazing customer support with almost immediate response and the help section is fantastic. The on-line program for auction items is a tremendous feature. This gave us the opportunity to market our auction items in advance of the event and create a buzz. We love the ability to be able to pull up past donations and have the fields autofill - that saved a lot of work the second year we used the software. We also love the scheduled communications. We scheduled an e-mail 2 days prior to the event to go to all attendees with information on parking, dress, etc., as well as an e-mail 2 days after the event thanking people for attending. Lastly, we LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the e-mail/text notification for auction winners. So many people have commented on how much they appreciate this feature.","I will say there were a few quirks with ticket purchasing. We had 2 couples buy tickets and have receipts but they were not in the software anywhere. This happened last year as well. Silent Auction has yet to find out why this happened, but overall the ticketing system works well. Since this quirk happened the first year we had a ""back up"" plan if it happened to anyone this year and how we would handle it. I wish the site was more clear about security of the site and that the credit cards are going through the paypal system, not our computers. Some people get funny about buying items on-line and we have had a few of these instances/complaints. I also wish it was more clear when someone was buying multiple tickets that the first ticket was going to the buyer - and if the buyer was buying tickets for someone else they could change this in the system if they were not attending or already purchased their ticket. I wish there was a way to modify the bid sheet layout. I think the site could easily become more user friendly by creating buttons for some commonly used things - such as create a donor, create a donation - instead of links buried down in the page. So many of the links look similar and can get confusing for people that are not using the software on a regular basis.","I would love to see the other side of the database developed - the expense side. I would like to be able to run true reports revenue verses expenses. I wish Silent Auction Pro would have additional fields that could be labeled however the customer needed them - similar to creating different types of tickets but for other needs related to auction items. Lastly, I have only one complaint about the cost. I understand and accept the cost and 2% for auction items, however, it doesn't seems fair to have the charity pays 2% of the cost of a consignment item (ie. trip, autographed album cover) that cost $1000's of dollars. The charity ends up paying silent auction pro most of the profit they make on the item if they only make a couple of hundred of dollars over the consignment price. I believe the 2% should be on what the charity makes net on the auction not gross.",,
3087,silent_auction_pro,Excellent Choice,Lara K.,Executive Director,,Less than 6 months,NO,Capterra,2017-10-07,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"This is terrific software, especially for a smaller nonprofit. What sold the software to us is that when I inquired about it online on a Saturday, I got an immediate phone call from the owner of the company and software developer. This was very typical of all interaction with this company throughout our use of the software - we got immediate responses from support when we had questions, they understand that auctions happen on weekends and support needs to be available then, and when we found a few quirks in the software they were repaired immediately, often by the developer personally. We previously used Greater Giving and BidPal; all three have features that I like and don't like, but overall SilentAuctionPro is by far the best value for the price. The a la carte pricing is a huge benefit for nonprofits like ours that cannot use all features (i.e. online bidding). Overall, from last year to this year (BidPal to SilentAuctionPro), we went from about 100 to 195 attendees, and from our worst checkout ever to our best. The instruction files, help menus, videos, etc were by the far the best of any nonprofit software we have used. We were invoiced after the auction for the software, which could be of great benefit for a nonprofit just starting out with their first auction.","I would love to be able to have a website where people can enter their own donations and have them populate as donation items in the system. There were a few quirks like the system not liking quote marks and ampersands. I would like for there to be a bit more explanation on the page about the security of registering your card as many of my guests weren't comfortable doing so at the time of ticket purchase. It would also be great to have more customization options for the ticket sales page. Because of the way we run our auction, I would very much prefer to be able to assign bidder #s to a household rather than to an individual, but this would have been fine if we had noticed it earlier and planned accordingly. I would also like to be able to customize a bit more on the receipts, include ticket descriptions, etc. I would have set up our fixed price items differently than we were advised to as I don't think it was the best option for our auction and was a bit of a hiccup, but in fairness it was something we didn't get to in advance and did on the fly, so it would have been avoidable with a little planning. Although the reports are generally pretty great, I did have to piece together a few to get to what I needed which could be a pain for someone with less Excel experience. Really minor, but because we can't use online bidding, I print our bidsheets on carbonless paper. Would very much prefer that the half sheet option printed as a 2up because I ended up reformatting them in Adob","Helped us run our best auction to date, with virtually no line at checkout, even though we had almost doubled our attendees from the prior year.",,

Demo environment allowed us to get committee members up to speed quickly and also allowed us to practice on some creative set up to meet our auction needs. Ticketing feature offered a variety of ticket options, some only displaying with a promo code, and love the addition of the asking for the email address for a ticket purchasers' guests - made it simple to reach all attendees with the marketing tools. Allowing the ticket purchasers to select the meal, or any other item we programmed made the table/catering coordination easy. Marketing features to promote the event to our attendees as well as help them feel connected to the event that was a couple months away. We set up an online auction the week before our event and people loved it! The online auction was open to the public so it allowed parents to share with friends and family that weren't planning on attending. We posted the event auction items on the online auction as previews to entice bidders to attend to get a chance at the rest of the silent and live items. Reporting is good, check in/out is all on one page, the system performance is great. Loved working in system even from our smart phone browser to check on things, make changes etc. any time, any where. Customer support was outstanding!","Special characters aren't allowed in donation title so we had to change once they got loaded as an auction item. Special characters in the description like "" for inch threw off the formatting of the data export to excel. Reporting is good, but would have liked a few more reports or the ability to create ad hoc reports. We found one report provided this item, but another report provided this item so we had to export to excel and do look up functions which is tedious to do each time. Would like more options for formatting of bid sheets, and also would like to see some additional options with displaying, leveraging the ""Donation Tag"" feature which is critical for us as our teams need to be identified. Would like filters on lists as well.",Set up and run the event solely from volunteer committee without having to contract with other services for ticketing or check in/out.

From donor setup, to bidding styles (purchase of ticket parties for Teacher Experiences, to Silent Auction bidding, setting different minimum bids etc) to performance tracking, exporting info, everything was there.3. The buzz that we created with the auction was definitely a boost to our event. We doubled our attendance vs. last year, just by starting the auction 4 weeks before the event, and creating excitement about the items that we offered early.4. I am now set up for next year, with over 50% of the input work established already (donors, pictures and logos, bidders, etc). Next year should be a lot easier!5. Auction Day section is powerful and easy to use - The check in was easy, online bidding was easy, and checkout was VERY easy, especially for those who had already registered their credit cards online. I could just click ""auto process"" for a batch of auction items, and with a click of the button, 20 people were checked out at once. Then I just looked up the auction number, passed out the gift envelopes or baskets, and done!",,,,,

And, I was able to enjoy the actual event for the first time.","Not really a con, but a suggestion if you use this software: have a designated person in charge of using the software and train everyone to enter the information consistently. I think their best practices was helpful'it saves time to make sure you take that step so you don't have to edit a bunch of things later.","Before finding Silent Auction Pro, we were doing everything by hand. It took up a lot of everyone's time and led to a lot of frustration. After a very stressful night of having people waiting for us to hand calculate their winning bids and asking us every five minutes if we were ready, we decided there must be a better way to do this. A fundraiser should be fun! It has fun in the name! So I found Silent Auction Pro. It made such a difference to not have all of those people waiting for us to give them their winning items and invoices. And, checking out was quick. I highly recommend for events like silent auctions.","This was a learning curve piece that I will share: sell tickets through silent auction pro'there isn't a charge to do it (we had already printed postcards and were selling tickets at the school so I didn't think about it the first time). If you sell the tickets using silent auction pro, all of the info is stored so you don't have to enter it later and it is much easier to track everything and the ticket purchasers don't even have to check in.",

Support team is very responsive and is constantly updating the product. It offers the absolute BEST value of any auction software I have used or researched! The mobile product is clean and user-friendly.,"Some of the functions are a bit hard to find. You do have to be a self-starter to research all of the functions and know exactly what is needed before the gala night to check in, check out, and close the auctions. I had to contact customer support several times throughout the evening for assistance.","As a nonprofit consultant, I have worked with a variety of nonprofit organizations on their gala auctions. I recommended Silent Auction Pro to a nonprofit pre-school for their gala. We utilized all of the features offered by SAP, including a live and silent auction, the mobile feature and the event planning features with a very user friendly table assignment function. The product is very responsive and intuitive, and helped this organization raise over $79,000 above sponsorships and ticket sales the night of the gala!","Start very early to learn the product and do all of the research. Work in their Sandbox demo and do a mock event training with committee members well before the event. Make sure you have plenty of people to do different functions - a separate cashier at check-in and throughout the event. Several committee members are needed to procure, enter auction donations and help package them. Another committee should be responsible for reservations, seating, and check-in.",

Previously, we relied on spreadsheets and emails, and version were easily confused and confusing. It was also great to tally up totals at the end of the evening quickly to make a grand total announce while all guests were present.","This was our organization's first time using mobile bidding and it was received with mixed reviews. It was confusing for some to login if they didn't receive an email. We will collect emails at registration next year to make it smoother. The QR codes on the items were great, but most guests did not already have the app on their phones. It was difficult, at times, to scroll through items. Lastly, it would be great to have a cross reference for ""baskets"" by individual. We weren't sure why the numbers continued from 2015 rather than starting fresh for the new event.","Silent Auction Pro is a powerful tool for fundraising events. Login is smooth for past members and new members of the organization. Once you're on the site for some time, it's neat to see all the various ways data can be sorted and viewed. Mobile bidding was an interesting transition for our group and guests, but I think it will become smoother every year. The software has made tasks for the auction and operations team smoother every year with the saved data. It was great to see our member's work real-time, so we knew where we were at for auction items and ticket sales. It's also great to have the data saved in one spot from year to year.","If you group will be going with the mobile bidding, try to post items in advance and have folks sign-up to the site in advance. If this happens, guests will spend less time at the event looking at their phone and trying to figure it out.",

Other pros: the functionality is robust, allowing us to do everything we need (set up online, silent, and live components of our auction, plus sell raffle tickets and track a fund-a-need). The platform is well organized and easy to navigate.","It does take some time up-front to learn the software and all that it can do.

In years past, our annual elementary PTO Fundraiser and Silent Auction was a tedious process. We would create our Bid Sheets and Display Sheets on separate programs. We would have another person create our event programs. Our donations would be logged in an Excel Spreadsheet. We would have ticket sales go through the office secretary. It wasn't seamless and it wasn't efficient. The checkout process at the event was also a mess as we didn't pre aucthorize credit cards and would have weeks of clean up trying to collect money from bidders who left without paying.",,

So when it came for me to organize an event, I pushed for using Silent Auction Pro mobile bidding though we were uncertain that our clientele would be receptive. Post the event, the response was almost all positive, they loved bidding on their mobile devices and we made much more money from our silent auction. We particularly loved the automated winner text notification and giving them the opportunity to self check-out/pay, making it all so much faster and easier. From the point of view of the auction administrator, it made my life much easier with no last minute pulling an all nighter to produce bidding sheets, etc. The customer service was superb and personalized. Someone always answered my calls, no matter the hour and helped resolve the issue(s) I was having or if they couldn't, they referred it to the developer who is the owner and soon afterwards all was resolved. I loved the reminders ahead of the event to ensure all was moving along smoothly and the personal calls to check in were very much appreciated. I felt fully supported at every step.",It was definitely challenging learning a new system but it was worth the time and effort. There were a few little quirks that need resolving and these I have shared with the developer.,I would definitely recommend using this software to others and will use again myself. There is no doubt that we brought in more money using Silent Auction Pro. Pay attention to detail on the front side and the event will run seamlessly.,,

We were able to track our history of donors and popular items, and streamlined our request process to focus on what bidders really wanted. Selling tickets to the event became a much easier process as well. The software was intuitive, and the customer service was great.","While we loved our experience with Silent Auction Pro, we eventually felt we needed to switch companies to a platform that allowed for public searches of online auctions, rather than requiring a link and approval from an Auction Chairperson. We switched to another company in order to take advantage of a large and searchable/public auction community. However, that switch has cost us much more money. Instead, a strong marketing campaign on social media would bring the extra bidders without paying the more expensive subscription fee that the other company charged us. I will encourage the next Auction Chairperson to use Silent Auction Pro.",Silent Auction Pro completely changed the way we ran our annual silent and live auction. It took us out of the time-consuming task of tracking everything by Excel worksheets and allowed us to focus more on the actual fundraising.,,

It is a fairly complex bit of software, so the first-time user may be a little daunted by all the options, but the support staff is always (And I do mean pretty much Always) available to explain things, and to help you figure out any issues. They can log in and look at your event with you, and give you real feedback, rather than just general suggestions, which is a huge help. The video instructional resources are also much more helpful that a printed set of instructions and are available on YouTube. It gave us a way to quickly determine how much we had made and which categories of items did the best. We also got a summary of who still hadn't paid for their items.",,,,,

As the Auction Administrator, I found the system to be intuitive and well-labeled. There was no searching and clicking through pages and pages to try to find what I needed. It is all presented clearly on the home screen that has a few clearly labeled tabs that will take you directly to whatever you need. The system can be tailored to your needs - we wanted only online/mobile bidding and we did not need card readers. So - we only selected what we needed and did not have to pay for any whistles and bells that weren't necessary. We were able to easily create an online catalog with photos and descriptions of each auction item, and we were able to paste the URL of the catalog onto our social media sites and into emails, therefore driving up the public interest in the event. We were able to have attendees pre-register, so when they arrived there were no long lines at the check-in table. Check-out went smoothly, too. All you have to do to process a check-out is to enter a bidder number. It generates a list of items and you simply confirm that you want to use the credit card already in the system (or cash/check if the person wants to pay in that manner). It's that simple. I received helpful emails from support staff alerting me to ""best practices"" and ""timelines"" without even asking. These emails helped to keep the auction planning on track and really identified potential trouble spots before they happened. There are tutorials/training videos built into the software, so training support staff is easy - you do not have to create your own manual or training sessions, it's done for you!",,,,,

It exceeded my expectations in every way.,"I have just recently organized my first charity auction fundraiser using Silent Auction Pro. As a complete novice, I found tremendous value in their free whitepaper full of incredibly helpful best practices for organizing auctions. We evaluated three software programs and went with Silent Auction Pro because it completely met our needs at a very reasonable price. It was available in several components we could pick and choose from to pay only for what we needed. For example, our audience wasn't ready for the online bidding capability, so we did not have to pay for that set of features. (With a younger attendee base, I would have jumped at the online component.) I found the software incredibly easy to use and got up to speed quite quickly. It was also very easy to train my auction support staff and the company offers a number of great YouTube training videos to help with that.",Don't look any further.

There are many reports that help you before, during and after your event. The support from the Silent Auction Pro team is top notch!",Some of the screens are too busy but once you get used to the software it's fine.,"I've used other silent auction software in the past. Silent Auction Pro is so much better than the other system. What makes it better?? Cost, ease of use, and most importantly support! I can't say enough about the on-going support that we receive from the Silent Auction Pro Team. We've used Silent Auction Pro for two events now, both have been a success. Each event gets better and each year we learn more functionality in the system. Silent Auction Pro continues to enhance their product. I would highly recommend Silent Auction Pro!",Make sure you order enough credit card readers. If using bid sheets make sure you have a couple of good printers. You would be surprised at how many drinks were spilled on bid sheets ;).,

Most all contingencies have bee thought through. Can be quickly rolled out quickly. No money need be paid out up front. Excellent customer support.,"There were a few contingencies which were not covered by the S/W or where the process was not intuitive. Part of our target audience/donor base is from an older demographic, part of which is uncomfortable with mobile phone apps and technology. We needed to develop work arounds to address these donors.","Great experience with Silent Auction Pro running a Benefit for an Outreach Program for a 200+ Year old Church. Silent Auction pro helped us to move Church fund raising approaches more fully into the 21st Century. Without Silent Auction Pro we could not have organized to stage the auction with the short time frame that we allowed ourselves. Had we organized ourselves to start the planning process earlier we could have been more successful with the ticket sales and fundraising, but in any case we exceeded our expectations.","Start the planning process early. Organize and select your volunteers early enough to train volunteers and rehearse the process. However, one we have started using the S/W, repeated uses should become much easier as we move down the learning curve.",

We had an event to go to- I made an account and purchased our tickets for the event and was assigned a bidder number for the event. I made a mistake and pressed the accept button 5 times and it charged my card 5 times! I immediately called and emailed customer service explaining my mistake. They took care of the problem right away and refunded the extra 4 charges. I received personal emails regarding the charges and how they were fixing it for me. It was great customer service! I was a bit hesitant about the online bidding process for the event. I've never been to a charity event where we didn't have to stay near the silent auction to keep an eye on our items that we wanted to ensure not getting out bid. I was unsure if it would be easy or difficult. Let me tell you- it was so easy! I logged into the website with the username and password that I set up when purchasing our tickets. My bidder number was automatic. I reviewed the auction items on the list. Walked around only once to choose which items we wanted to bid on. I bid on several items and then I was free to go to our table and enjoy the dinner and social hour without having to stalk the silent auction area! I watched my items- it notified me when I was outbid. I continued to bid on the things we really wanted. After the bidding ended it let me know which items we won and the checkout process was a piece of cake too. Press the button to buy and it charged my credit card on file. It was so simple and we really enjoyed our event. We donated to a great cause and this system made it a lot easier! Thanks so much!,,,,,

We moved from using an Excel spreadsheet which became very hard to manage since our donations were increasing. The functionality fit us perfectly along with a price point that we could afford. For each of the 6 years, we always have question that come up and the SAP customer service always responds in a timely fashion. The use of SAP also has minimized if not eliminated the auction customer issues we encountered while using a spreadsheet to manage everything.

An event agent called me the day before and the day of the event, to help with any last minute issues. Although the front end interface is not fancy, our guests found the site easy to use. Silent Auction Pro offered the best, most economical price structure of all the Auction Software, and I did a lengthy comparison in a spreadsheet of all the auction software out there.

Our school has had an auction for 17 years. We found the web-based platform to be very flexible and easy to use for multiple volunteers from home or any other place they have access to Internet. Silent Auction Pro was very responsive and able to help us work through many issues. There are many great functionalities that are available with the system if they are purchased.One issue we noticed was that we frequently have items at our Live auction that are high dollar and are purchased by several bidders who want to split the cost and claim as a tax deduction. The previous system we used had an option on the software known as a ""split bid"". Our data entry person would enter the numbers of the bidders who wanted to split the total cost of an item. These bids would have the same item number and each bidder would have a correct dollar amount of what they paid for the item on their tax letter. We were disappointed that Silent Auction Pro did not have this capability since our old system did. Overall, we like the real-time tracking of all the donations and income. It would be fantastic if there was one area to log expenses.",,,,,
3130,silent_auction_pro,LOVE this auction software!!,Lorretta S.,,,,NO,Capterra,2015-10-08,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"This software is an absolute MUST if you're running a charitable auction. It completely steam-lines our auction processes. I've used it for 3 auctions and can't imagine ever planning and executing an auction without it again. (In fact, I refuse to plan a fundraiser if I can't use the software now that I know how valuable it is.) The planning and preparation of an auction is incredibly time consuming and this Silent Auction Pro took the struggle out of the process. We significantly reduced auction check-out time with the stored credit card pre-authorization function. Not only does this help our attendees as they can securely enter their credit card numbers on-line themselves, it also helps our volunteers as we don't have to spend time entering credit card information in order to check them out. In addition, all auction purchases can be very quickly charged even if the winner is not present and each winner immediately receives an invoice via email. If there's a mistake, refunds can also be given very simply. There are so many fantastic features that I can't speak of them all here but will mention another favorite, the Auction Program feature. You can quickly and easily print Auction Programs which include all auction items titles, descriptions and auction numbers with a simple export! Amazing! Thank you Silent Auction Pro! Jim Donnell is also very responsive and helpful if there's ever a question about the product and how it can serve your auction.",,,,,

We knew we were struggling with check in and check out lines and not giving our guests the best possible experience at the event. I did some research and found Silent Auction Pro. We were able to call and get a demo the next day - we couldn't believe how user friendly the system was and how much it would cut down on the time it took us to manually create packages and create display sheets. I was also excited about how easy it would be to send a thank you to event attendees, bidders and donors the day after the event. I also had access to all sorts of reports following our gala and could quickly generate statistics from the event. This all usually takes me up to a week after the event to pull all the information. We received great feedback on the ease of use - we jumped right in and used the mobile bidding. Guests of all ages could use their smartphone or go to a kiosk in the room to quickly place bids and receive notifications if they had been outbid, leaving them more time to socialize with other guests. Customer service was awesome - we had a question during the event, we called and talked to someone right away who walked us through exactly what we needed to do.

The feedback from our attendees was very positive. We believe the only way to go now is online and paperless. We have always had outstanding support from SAP. The software lets you perform routine tasks once and automates the rest. Excellent data export capability. It makes the event enjoyable for volunteers and attendees. Between the school and church auctions we have run 8 events with Silent Auction Pro and raised over $383K. We are going to continue to use the software as it seems to get better every year and worth every penny. The software is easy to use and learn. There are huge advantages when next year's event rolls around and everyone knows what to do from the beginning and they can work from home with the web based software.The only con at the event was not related to the software but cell phone coverage. Customers of a popular cell phone carrier with an Android phone had good service but the same carrier with an iPhone was not good. It would be an idea to use wireless access points that can accommodate a sufficient number of guest accounts or rent/buy a cell phone signal booster/relay if there are any concerns about less than excellent cellphone coverage for all carriers in your area.,,,,,

Easy to fix but you do have to fix it.,"The best part of SAP is the time it saves for completing your auction and checking everyone out. We use the system to enter all donations and create our paper bid sheets. First we go online only, then we print everything for the final on site bidding. The spreadsheets and lists that are automatically created allow us to double check that everything we received has actually been entered and assigned numbers. It is also so helpful that it can track different accounts within the system. We are raising money for more than one troop and we need to be able to see the final numbers for each troop. SAP does this for us. The check-out is a breeze if you have already entered credit card information when people are assigned their bid numbers.",Wasn't hard to learn to use.,

The day of service was incredible. We ran into a problem we hadn't thought about prior and they answered immediately and I was able to make my bidder happy again within minutes. The mobile bidding was wonderful; it definitely keeps people engaged and the price going up when everyone gets text message alerts! I feel like I only scratched the surface of everything Silent Auction Pro has to offer. I cannot wait to use them for our event next year and make it even bigger and better. I don't know how the competitor companies get away with charging what they do. Silent Auction Pro does it all for a fraction of the price.

The system recommended entering couples as individuals, this also proved to create problems for us when assigning tables and during the check-in/check-out process.","After vetting a few other products similar to Silent Auction Pro, we opted to use SAP for our 3rd Annual Event. The price of SAP was considerably less than other products and the features comparable. Customer service was top notch! We had relied on spreadsheets for our prior 2 events and SAP saved an enormous amount of staff time before, during, and after the event.",,

High use of Bidding and reporting. Ease of use entering donations and creating Auction items.,There was nothing that I disliked about this product except that it would need the ability to have multi winners.,"The main problem we were trying to resolve was the Check-in process and checkout process. Both were easily to resolved with Silent Auction Pro (SAP). Another common issue we had was the ability to grab more bids per auction item. We found a major increase in bidding per person with SAP. Along with this tool, we are now able to see what and who donated items as in the past we were not able to track this. Having the ability to now see the percent return on auction items which we never had before.

Once you get your bearings, practicing on their well thought demo group, it is a cinch to use! I would highly recommend new users take the time to familiarize yourself with the program by surfing around the demo group and asking many questions way before your event is well under way and donations start rolling in. By doing this, it will elevate any issues when you are in the thick of event craziness and just don't have the time to call for help. Any questions I had were answered quickly and completely. Tracking winners, auction totals and all donations is super simple and made post event wrap up a breeze. My biggest fear at any of my events is always check out and this program made it so smooth, I almost questioned if I was doing it right. I would highly recommend Silent Auction Pro to a anyone who wants to run a less chaotic event.",,,,,

The transition from online to paper was seamless. For any of the online auction items that did not have bids we could simply printed bid sheets and put them into the silent auction. We had several multi winner items such as a Dodgeball Party that were offered in both auctions. It was easy to just print the bid sheets that already recorded the bids captured during the online auction. We also loved the fact that the multiple payments can be processed for an individual bidder and the invoice/receipt clearly captures the payment activity. During the weeks leading up to our event I had multiple questions for the technical support group. I posted my questions to support@silentauctionpro.com and always received a quick and thorough response. I think their support is top notch. We will definitely use Silent Auction Pro again next year.",,,,,

Many auction items went for their true value, which helped us raise more money for our schools.The support staff were extremely helpful and always available to answer questions or review how we were using the tool.",There wasn't a lot that I didn't like about this software tool.

There are a lot of features to choose from but you may need to hunt around a little to understand what everything does. The videos on the website are very helpful. Customer service is personally delivered and very responsive. We've worked with SAP to run our annual auction for about 5 years now and we've been happy every time. This was our first year running the auction completely online and the check out process at the end of the night was a breeze!

The feedback we received from the people who were biding on our items was, ""how easy it was to use."" Our only concern was on the admin side. Because we were in such a tight window from start to finish the admin side of the program seemed a little daunting. there were a ton of different drop down menus to navigate through. the software seemed to work well and like I said before the feedback from the bidders was they liked it and it was easy to use. Recommendation is give your self a couple of weeks to get familiar with the system, also if you can preregister people for the event this works best. We had 1200 people at a concert and trying to register everyone was overwhelming.

The back-end (admin) functions were a bit tricky for us to learn, but the Pro staff was always there to help answer our question or assist us which cut the learning curve down significantly. In addition, the founder is heavily involved in ensuring each customer is satisfied with the software and is always looking for guidance and feedback on how the software/user-experience can be improved.

We typically have around 120 to 140 items in our auction. This is the second year using Silent Auction Pro. My only regret is that we didn't learn about this product earlier. Before ... the checkout process was one gigantic zoo, people were backed up forever, and trying to manually create and add up invoices was awful (and needless to say, we had many disgruntled attendees when it was all over). With Silent Auction Pro, the checkout process has actually become the easiest part of the event now. And, the reporting features the system has, is incredibly easy to use. Plus, having the database prepopulated with names and e-mails from the previous year, made the check-in process move more swiftly than ever.

I've used much higher-priced auction software in the past and found this to have just as many features as any of those. The customer service piece of it was great. There was always someone available to answer questions over the phone. The video tutorials were very helpful in training the day of staff. It took me 5 minutes to get any volunteer into the system and to learn how to perform any of the functions. With any auction, there is time involved and no software can take that aspect away but using this software saves time in the long run by creating a lot of the materials you will need before, during and after your auction.",,,,,

Their staff had an answer for every question we had as well as tips for making the whole event go smoothly. It was amazing to log in on the day after our gala and have all of our auction data grouped and organized and a complete database of all of our guests.

It took me a little while to get used to it, being mainly a case of trial and error, as there are no real guidance notes; but some advice from a previous user helped considerably. With a bit of experience it is relatively easy to use, although I do have trouble moving between screens to check entries. I also have trouble swapping between data entry and viewing the public screen; it won't always let me view the public side after I have been entering information. It seems to get stuck in one mode at a time.",,,,,
3360,ticketsource,Reliable and efficient,Maxine H.,,,,NO,Capterra,2017-01-11,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,"We have been using Ticketsource for at our theatre for approximately 5 years now. The system works well for our customers who can book seats at a time that suits them and we do not have to be on site to take bookings. As a small venue this is very cost effective for us as we do not have to staff a 24hour box office. Our staff we find the systems straightforward and reliable. We have all the booking details at our fingertips, so we are able to answer customer queries efficiently. Archive materials are easily accessible which makes financial reconciliation straightforward and transparent.We are able to link directly to our website and can also benefit from the wider Ticketsource community on line.Ticketsource allows us to customise each event to our own needs allowing us to create tailor made seating plans, pricing structures and booking discounts and incentives. We can add information and publicity material to each performance.Customer support is very good with a number of options including FAQ's to assist with basic problems, an on line help facility and a telephone help line. The site also includes very helpful tutorials for setting up events and trouble shooting, which are brief and not at all patronising.Ticketsurce also allows us to run our own box office at strategic times and as much of our business is from schools, dance schools and local amateur companies within a small radius of the venue, it means that customers have the option not to get involved in the extra cost of booking fees.It would help us greatly as a venue if there were an option to print off whole shows with all the ticket prices on one ticket, as many amateur groups who sell within their own small community like to take possession of all the tickets to sell directly. I am aware that this does not benefit Ticketsource and would make accounting for ticket sales impossible, but many of our clients would prefer to have multiple prices on each ticket, enabling them to highlight the price paid or to cross off the other prices. I'm not sure if other venues would benefit from this service and I fully appreciate that we may be in the minority.I would certainly recommend Ticketsource to venues of all sizes as it really is a complete package. The rates are reasonable and the support is excellent",,,,,
3361,ticketsource,Outstanding,Michael H.,Theatre Coordinator,,,NO,Capterra,2014-10-08,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,"We have been using TicketSource as our sole provider for Box Office solutions now for just over a year.

3364,ticketsource,Hard to fault TicketSource,Paul K.,,,,NGC,Capterra,2017-01-11,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,I have been using TicketSource for 18 months and once you get to understand what the various options are and how to deal with the charges (fee added on in full or fixed amount etc) it is simplicity itself to use thereafter. Help is at hand if you don't understand the online instructions. Copying and then amending an existing event to create a new event makes life very easy as you do not have to enter all the regular details each time. Reporting is excellent on both customers and event ticket sales and having emails when there has been a sale is an excellent facility to keep track of progress on ticket sales.,,,,,

3366,ticketsource,Wonderful service,Paul K.,Events Coordinator,,,NGC,Capterra,2014-10-08,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"TS is one of those rare services that delivers exactly what it says. For a small arts organisation that is always looking for cost-effective solutions, TS has proved invaluable to us. It is easy to use, provides a variety of information in formats that can be exported to our other systems and flexible enough to not only serve as an in-house box office, but also as an on-line customer service which can be managed off-site by our volunteers - everything we need.Its customer service is truly outstanding. On the rare occasions when we have had to contact them with a technical issue it is resolved quickly and efficiently. Sometimes we have asked for slight changes to made to the system and, when possible, these have always been made.The only small criticism I would make is with regard to the ticket printer which every now and again stops working. This seems to be caused by a problem with the printer cache which, because it is not on our network, has to be cleared by TS. Again, technical support resolves this quickly and has made suggestions for preventing future problems.",,,,,

Simple to use system, however we still have issues with the scanners and collation of scanned users3. Versatile product - but the functionality to allow the client to associate a bar code with a particular seat for Season Ticket holders would be useful. For example we need bar codes printed onto cards before a person has chosen an actual seat.4. Competition is growing from other similar companies offering to charge ticket commissions of 5% and payments made as they are purchased by the customer - From our company viewpoint we are very happy with Ticketsource but we have to evaluate options, especially commercial ones that serve our customers and cash flow better from a commercial standpoint.",,,,,

3371,ticketsource,Ticket Source Review,Paul F.,Organiser,,,NGC,Capterra,2014-10-08,4,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,Ticket Source is a very able ticket sales solution for events (we use if for a Fireworks event). It has lots of functionality and flexibility which is what we need. The only con I can think of this that it's a bit expensive in terms of the cut Ticketsource take from sales - we're a non-profit / fundraising event and we would have hoped that Ticketsource would have let us keep more of the profits for the charity donations we make from the proceeds of the event.,,,,,

The venue was run by one full time and one part time staff, so minimising effort was very important for us. TicketSource makes everything so easy. It took less than an hour for us to set up the system, from scratch, including seating plans, venue details box office front-end and Facebook integration. Customer support from TicketSource has also been first rate. One one occasion, I had to phone them an hour before a show went up and they quickly resolved my problem over the phone.",,,,,

Faultiness of charger then completely denied by customer service, will not be using ticketsource again, is ridiculous after they made around å£1300 from the event.",,,,,

However, the system is really intuitive and easy to use. They have added extra functions over the years and it feels very bespoke given how it can be adapted to different venues and events. I feel it is by far the most friendly and easy to use system out there.",The only thing (as a charity) we don't like is that any donations also get a surcharge as it feels like a heavy penalty on people's generosity over and above what they pay for their ticket fee.,,,
3380,ticketsource,Live Music!,Ian S.,,,,NGC,Capterra,2017-01-11,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"I've been using Ticketsource for nearly four years with a Live music project in the Yorkshire Dales. the system allows multiple venues to be stored so setting up a gig is as simple as copy event and change the band name. I use a bar code scanner at event which makes entry easy and looks awesome. most of my guests just use the home printed tickets and the system alerts if someone tries to cheat. Support is great, but hardly had had to use it. it works best with wifi access at the venues but can be ran off line if down loaded once online ticket sales close. A great advantage it that cash sales pre event can be entered free of charge for those guests without internet. The only disadvantage is the sales payment is not made until the Wednesday after a weekend event which effects cash flows if you have a expensive band to pay on the night. In conclusion its a fab system which is easy to use and sell tickets online, hopefully I will be using Ticketsource for years to come.",,,,,

Last year we had a couple of problems that didn't help the way we handled our tickets but we went back with ways of how they could improve and their technical team worked together to help us. With their help we were able to sell our tickets with no problems at all. The back of house system worked really well for us, as a company we sell lots of different ticket types and its important to be able to pull off reports, check customers details and doing this with TicketSource was very easy. If we had any questions or were struggling to set up the event the customer support was brilliant and very helpful! As we are a seasonal event we only use TicketSource for a certain amount of time but we will certainly be returning to use them again. Highly recommend!",,,,,

Should we have any questions or queries there is someone to come to our aid either by phone, online chat or email. The customer service personnel are very patient and helpful.As someone who has limited understanding of technical knowhow I can get frustrated when trying to follow tutorials as there can be points that look simple enough but I get myself into difficulties.

3384,ticketsource,Absolutely Ideal for Amateur Theatre Groups,Laurie R.,Chairman,,,NGC,Capterra,2014-10-09,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,10.0,The TicketSource site is quite the best I have found for on-line booking for our shows. We are just starting to accept bookings on line and were very nervous about the things that could go wrong leaving our customers frustrated and angry. I am pleased to say that nothing like this has happened and the feedback we have had so far is very favourable. The reports that are readily available keep us in control of the sales and monitor their progress. The detailed financial reports and the prompt payment of receipts are a boon to our treasurer. I particularly like the way we can integrate the on-line sales with our over the counter sales as many of our older patrons are uneasy about using computers to buy things on-line.The facilities in the software range from very simple to the most elaborate you could imagine.I would not hesitate to recommend this site to any Amateur Groups.,,,,,

3386,ticketsource,Great service!,Charlie C.,Director of Finance,,,NGC,Capterra,2014-10-08,5,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"We've been using TicketSource for a few years now for our amateur theatre, and have been very happy with the service. It's pretty simple to use, and a lot of extra functionality has been added since we started using it. Unlike Microsoft, however, they don't completely rewrite the interface every time they make a change! One of the unexpected side-effects of migrating to online ticketing is that, because they can see how many tickets are still available, our patrons often leave it to the last minute before booking, which gives some directors sleepless nights!In our experience, customer service has been brilliant. We haven't experienced many problems, but any issues or questions raised have alway been dealt with very promptly, and the technical staff seem to very be open to sensible changes requested by their customers.",,,,,
3387,ticketsource,Great Service,Mark F.,Chairman,,,NGC,Capterra,2014-10-08,5,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,10.0,This is such a useful service for small organisations who want to sell tickets over the internet. We are a small amateur drama society who do no more than å£4000 a year ticket revenue but find it is well worth while. It is very flexible and if you are reasonably comfortable with using the web it should not take more than an hour to learn how to use it.,,,,,

It's very easy to use - customers have given great feedback and I've been able to edit events with no fuss. On a couple of occasions I have called the help line and they have been very quick to answer - no long waits which is so often the case with other companies and they have been able to advise and sort my question straight away.

Easy to setup, simple to use and it has some great features too. The only two improvements I would suggest is with the free scanning app for iOS and Android where it was sometimes a 'hit & miss'. The other improvement could be with the 'refund' process where one can only refund in full and part refund requires ringing in to their support rather than having to deal with it ourselves online. But overall it was an excellent experience for us and we will certainly be using them again! Highly recommended!",,,,,

I went to the website and the site was simple and informative and within minutes I had all information for me to advise the committee about it. The commttee deceided to use them and I was instructed to to go ahead and I then went back to the website and within minutes I had arranged an account and it did not take long to get our tickets online. The tickets sell well and we can get all the information about our ticket sales and at the end of the sales period the money is transfered to our bank account with no fuss.It would be fair to say that they offer a first class service with no fuss and if you need any help then it is only an email or phone call to get it sorted.,,,,,

Even though I was a first time user of on-line ticketing, I was pleased by the ease with which I could set up details for the event. I used the system at a basic level but there is plenty of scope for more sophistication, for example, bar code scanning. Over 70% of our tickets were sold via TicketSource.",,,,,

You only know at the end of the process whether it was a good decision or not, and I can say now that I'm at the end, it was a good decision. I'm a fairly competent user of IT software and found my way around everything ok. I've marked it down to a very good 4 stars on 'ease of use' as I feel that it probably could be just a little bit more user friendly to people who aren't IT literate. The FAQ section is also very useful. I would recommend this to others and will also be using it again in the future.",,,,,

An option or tick box of what events to be listed to the site would be an bonus as we like to great tickets for competition or complimentary tickets but if you create an event for free tickets they will automatically be listed on our website - I hope that makes sense.,,,,,

The system is easy to set up, even for the complicated ticketing systems we need for some venues. Once in place, it is easy to adjust and, more importantly, our end users find it easy to use. The reports are excellent and one key area we have never been able to look at in detail before is our marketing. We are now able to target the right places for marketing our events to ensure maximum take-up of tickets. Overall we are very happy with our first few months of using Ticket Source",,,,,

This occurred several times. I'm not sure if it was the laptop or scanner/connection that was at fault but without doing another event will not know.That aside, the system worked well and the ticket that I made purposely void was met with a loud refusal bleep.Overall the system is good and kept a large sum of money in electronic transfers rather than cash on the gate.Recommended.",,,,,

The reporting system is excellent and having a day to day review of ticket sales enables us to target our marketing where it is needed.One minor quibble: The ""Next"" , ""Print tickets""and ""Back"" buttons are placed at the bottom of each page and can be missed.

3438,ticketsource,Great product and great product support,Bob S.,,,,NO,Capterra,2017-01-11,5,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,My only negative is: we usually have a different layout in our auditorium for each of our 5 plays and we offer a password early booking week for members. This means that for each block of seats (typically 3 and sometimes more) there is a lot of setting up for each production. A way of making this easier would be great. Otherwise a great product and great support whenever needed.,,,,,

The company I worked for owned an aquarium, tour boat, banquet hall and an exhibition center. I used this software to create group reservations and to check-in groups upon arrival. This software worked very well for the general admission process and the point of sale terminals in the gift shop and the cafe. The yearly gift shop inventory process went smoothly using this software. The company also sent someone to our location to help us get acclimated to the new system.","Personally, I had two main problems with this software. The first problem involved the creation of group visits, we had previously been able to create a group account for a group that was a repeat visitor. Once the account was created, you could pull up the account and view the organization's history of visiting the aquarium. We no longer had this option with Gatemaster. Each visit was a desperate entity and this caused difficulties when billing groups with multiple visits; that required one invoice sent to their corporate office.

The second problem involved combination tickets. The combination tickets included visits to both the aquarium and the tour boat or the aquarium and the exhibition center. I would create daily attendance reports which became problematic with Gatemaster because the software was always double counting the attendance on the combination tickets. If a person purchased a combination ticket, the computer counted it as two people visiting not one. We were unable to separate the combination attendance from the admission only attendance. This aspect of Gatemaster was extremely frustrating and it was impossible to get accurate attendance numbers.",The product works well if it suits your business exactly as created. The problems occur if and when you need to customize the software to suit your needs. It is very difficult to change or modify this software. If you need this product for basic point of sales processing you should be fine.,,

I was pleasantly surprised when the told me that for a small fee that would not only help me reinstall that software but also update us to their most recent version. I purchased that hardware myself and spent about a week on the phone with the tech support getting everything working again. I can't say enough about the hospitality of the tech support staff.

But that is also the same complaint our patrons have about us! We are only staffed at the Box Office on Wednesday and Friday afternoons, however, with most of our patrons with the internet they are able to conduct business with us either on our website or via e-mail.","After reviewing and considering about 6 different ticketing programs, we decided that Tick It offered the most value and could provide us with any reports we might want. We were looking for a system that we could use just in the house and then at a later time put on-line. Since we were able to keep the program and data on our own computers we were able to access data at any time and create queries to get info in a useful format for us. Tech Support is great they have helped solve any problems in a quick and efficient manner. The only thing that is a little inconvenient is the time difference between Michigan and California. But we have never had a ""crisis"" that kept us from operating because of this. We are able to record just about anything we want to track in each customer profile.

We are able to issue gift certificates, flex passes, coupons, season tickets, and reports for our patrons listing their donations. We are able to train volunteers to use the ticketing system very quickly. NCSoftware is constantly improving the programs adding features - even some at our suggestion. When we expanded and put our ticketing online, NCSoftware was available to answer all our question in getting it set up on our own server. Although Chautauqua Playhouse is probably one of NCSoftware's smallest venues they assist us with any problems or changes that we come up with. We are a venue with 96 seats, but we have many of the same needs that a much larger venue would benefit from. We are able services for our patrons that we were not able to do before, like ticket exchanges completed over the phone, patrons don't have to worry about turning in their old tickets to get their new ticket. The system cancels the ticket number of the exchanged ticket and issues a new ticket which is printed in our office as well as emailed to the patron One of the new features added was a reminder email is sent to each patron reminding them the show they are scheduled for, it is sent one or two weeks before the date and then again on the date of the performance, our patrons really appreciate this feature. I would recommend this program for any venue looking for a new system, or upgrading from another provider.",We also use this software at our snack bar to facilitate inventory control and POS terminal.

We like being able to design and print our own tickets and customize them to our needs.

I received excellent one-on-one help from New Concepts. They always listened to my questions and helped me to understand their program and how it could work for us. Always available when I call and quick to respond.

I would and have recommended this software to other school districts.

This software can also be used for other events that go on in high schools; i.e, concerts, plays, etc.

You can create an event very easily, share it across multiple platforms, there's a direct link to your Facebook business events page from Eventbrite. Making it super easy to get the word out.","So, some of the requested features; we would like to see more customization in the actual Eventbrite page itself and as well the emails that are sent out to your invitees. So at the moment, I think there's only two templates and you can't really do much to change the look and feel, or the text within it, so it would be great to be able to customize those features a little bit.","It's good for anybody that's organizing an event obviously, the nice thing about Eventbrite is that it's free to use long as you're not charging for the event. There is a fee if you are charging for the event so the fees are 2.5% plus 99 cents transaction fee. So that's a service fee to Eventbrite for using their platform. Again, this is only if you're charging for the ticket, and then if there's a credit card use, then the credit card fee is 3.5% which is quite high, but when you factor in the time to chase attendees for invoice payments it's kind of a no brainer",,

It was simple, easy, had the information I was looking for where I expected it to be and all (comprehensive) steps that led me through researching the event (MTP Hamburg) to choosing what I specifically wanted to finalizing booking completely without any hassle. A while later I had to organize an Event myself and remembered my positive experience as a user, which I wanted to provide to attendees of my event as well. It was then, that I realized how much this has to do with the way you setup an event from inside Eventbrite. There is a verry good guide for setting up events and a step by step tour for beginners. There also are recommendations about what to do when and what information might be expected by potential attendees. I liked the basic support which was included as a beginner. Also, there are areas where Eventbrite clearly draws a line regarding its functionalities and forwards you to connected third party services (as for example if you want super fancy badges or have more esoteric data mining procedures in mind regarding your attendees data). As a newbie to event management AND Eventbrite in particular I was also happy about the broad spectrum of FAQ and help videos. I was very happy to be supplied with a solution that provided me with high quality, easy to use features and was free to use for my non-profit event on top of it.",Speaking of FAQ and learning how to use Eventbrite it is true that there is a lot of material available online. Sadly there is also light and shadow to this. Some of the explanations I found online were clearly dated and others did either not cover the specifics of the topic I needed (recommendation / invitation based multi stepp application requests) or referred to things which had been changed in the past. Also the Options for the design and look of the Event Homepage were limited. These aren't necessarily bad things only. BEing forced to stay with a simple (but still beautiful) Layout as well as required to go with a simpler application process then I imagined in the end turned out to be good as it simplified things and allowed me to concentrate on matters more central to the event I was planning. It just needed some letting go first and willingness to do it differently than I first had imagined.,"The event I attended which was managed via Eventbrite hat serval hundred attendees. From a visitors perspective anything worked flawlessly and smooth. The event I set up was a lot smaller but also worked out great from an organizers point of view. I am confident Eventbrite played a central role to this as it streamlined the organisation and the preparation as well as positively supported the execution of the events. Eventbrite is a modern, fast and anticipating web application that is easy to use and works for teams colaborating in organizing small and obviously medium to large sized events. It also funnels some of your more exotic ideas about how your event should work down a reasonable lane, which is healthy, es pecially for newcomers and the less experienced. I simply can recommend Eventbrite and will use it again for our followup event(s) in 2019.",,
3728,eventbrite,Solid Event Hosting Option With a Few Quirks,Marc H.,Director of Marketing,,6-12 months,NGC,GetApp,2016-01-26,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,"With a large number of ""event applications"" out there, Eventbrite has found its way to the top of that list thanks mostly to their easy to use interface and well thought out back-end that not only covers all of an event host's bases but also integrates with other areas of their marketing. Free to anyone who isn't requiring payment for tickets, Eventbrite makes it easy to quickly put together a good looking registration page fast, without the hassle of payment or subscriptions. The paid feature for anyone requiring ticket fees is a little more rigid in how the user can collect it's money which can make it a little tougher to work with depending on how badly you need the revenue from your ticket sales. The payment processing fees are still reasonable, though.","-Powerful system that provides a large number of great features (creating, promoting, tracking, checking-in, analyzing) for free -Event page creation is quick and easy. If you want something simple, you can be done in minutes. If you want to customize different areas of the design and registration process, you have that ability as well. -Integrations with outside marketing platforms like HubSpot and MailChimp allow the user to connect their other marketing platforms together to create the most powerful event marketing toolset you could ask for. -Relatively good analytics and reporting sections gives you solid insight into how successful your event was and where you can improve moving forward. -The mobile application (Neon) for event hosts makes checking in attendants a breeze by either scanning the printed tickets Eventbrite provides or just finding their name and swiping your finger across it! -Customer support is relatively attentive (I've averaged around 3-5 minutes on hold before speaking to a representative via phone) and the knowledge base they've set up on their website it pretty helpful when it comes to answering some of your intermediate-level questions around customization and platform functionality.","-The paid feature is a little rigid when it comes to payout structure compared to other options. You normally can't receive payout for your ticket revenue until your event ends, making it a tough option for those looking to promote an event months in advance who need the revenue now. Definitely something to consider. They provide early payout, but depending on how much revenue you're expecting to generate, that may not even be a viable option. -Customizing your registration page with your brand's colors, logos and images can be difficult and require some coding skills.

3729,eventbrite,A solid simple event registration platform,Verified Reviewer,Director of Marketing,,,NGC,GetApp,2018-09-11,4,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,9.0,,"Eventbrite is fairly simple to use and has most the features you would want laid out so you can build an event registration form in steps. Once you set up your account(s) if you are accepting payments, it is straightforward to duplicate events to make new ones as long as they require similar details. There are custom fields you can create with logic behind them so different users may have different options depending on the access you choose for them. There are also ways to create discount codes or hidden fields with different levels of access. This is very useful when you have tired pricing at events and variable discounts to various groups.","A lot of the settings are in places that don't make much sense and you have to go to completely different sections of the admin section to find settings that you would think are closely related to each other. Some of the features are on by default and you might never notice them until after your event registration has launched. Even though most the settings are easy to change, you basically have to go over every tab, page and setting to be sure they are all correct before you launch your campaign. When you use the custom data fields and discount features, it isn't immediately clear how it all works and again, you need to go to a couple different pages to get them set up properly so it takes some trial and error.","This is a great solution for simple, straightforward events without too many options. Once you get a lot of different sessions or tracks and registration types, it either can't accommodate or becomes very complicated to manage. Like other tools of this nature, there is a bit of a generic feel to it but that is the compromise for a widely accepted overall, plug and play software. It is effective but there are other solutions that are similar or easier to use and offer more customization options. It is highly likely that we will replace this software with something else in the near future.",,
3730,eventbrite,"Great functionality, amazing when listing free events, fees are a bit expensive for paid events",Verified Reviewer,Director of Marketing,,,NGC,GetApp,2018-10-29,5,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,8.0,,"Eventbrite has lots of functionality that you will need when organising and managing an event. It is very easy to use, plus it can integrate with other apps such as Mailchimp which comes in handy when broadcasting an event and Surveymonkey which comes in handy to send out feedback forms post an event. The back office functionality is great too -- you can email invitations directly without using Mailchimp if you wanted to. For users, it's easy and simple to register, plus Eventbrite offers a secure online payment option which is hassle free for both organiser and attendee.","2 things that I like the least about Eventbrite are: 1) Non-existent customer service. One of the reasons why I used Picatic (which they have now bought!) was due to their great customer service. You can chat with a real person who can help you with some of the questions which are not answered in their FAQs. 2) They're great if you have a free event, but if you have a paid event, their transaction fees are one of the highest in the market.","I organise a lot of professional networking events, some are free and some are paid for. Eventbrite offers me all the functionality I need to organise my event. I used Picatic until Eventbrite recently acquired Picatic. However, customer support from Eventbrite is very difficult, if not existent. So if you have a question not answered by the standard FAQ, such as, ""Since Eventbrite acquired Picatic, how I can access my previous/ currently live events""?, the only way I could find customer support was by tweeting Eventbrite. So, Eventbrite is great if you can self-service and publish free events, but once you have quirky questions, be prepared that it will be difficult to establish contact to a human person who can answer.",,

You can have your event ticketing up and running in minutes. I have been using Eventbrite for ticketing for about five years. It has helped make event management so much easier.

Easy integration into websites and emails. I have recommended Eventbrite to so dozens of businesses, organizations and individuals. Easy to use product and with all that I often have going on, it's nice to know I can depend on Eventbrite to quickly make a difference.","You can search for a registration based on a registrant's name. However, you cannot print a report by Registrant's last name. Not being able to print a registration report by the name of the registrant is the only reason I gave this product four stars instead of five stars. Help screens are good.

Before using Eventbrite, we were building our events on our website which looked awful and dull. It would take a lot of time for not much reward. With Eventbrite, I can create a basic event in a matter of a few minutes. I can make it private or public to be shared with the Eventbrite community. Best of all, most of our events are free to enter, which means it's free to post them on Eventbrite. It's easy to check attendees in at the door, download reports, and communicate last-minute messages with registrants. Eventbrite is a great tool more companies should take advantage of.","In some instances, we've held events that require many conditional questions to be completed during registration. Unfortunately, Eventbrite doesn't allow the function of complex, conditional questions, which can really slow down the registration process. On the backend, the menu names aren't the most intuitive. There are certain functions that are difficult to find, such as where to cancel an order, but after expanding each sidebar menu, you can usually find which what you need. My biggest pet peeve with Eventbrite is that if you create an event that takes place more then five weeks away, ticket sales will automatically be set to end in five weeks from that date, regardless of when your event takes place. There have been many times when I've forgotten to change this default date and received complaints of ticket sales being closed weeks prior to an event. I wish Eventbrite would make the default date the date of the event.","Eventbrite is free for free events, easy to set up and looks professional.",,

From personal experience on the user side, I love that once you've RSVPed, you get a clear confirmation email that allows you to easily 'add' the event to your calendar of choice (or you can do this from the Eventbrite page right after you've RSVPed), and Eventbrite plugs in all the relevant information into your calendar.

There is pay function but I haven't used it. I've used it for promo events I have and want to advertise it out to people. It goes online free to anyone searching for events in my area. It's a great tool to track and take payments if you want. It'll get all the information from your people enrolling so you can track them for the future. I network with other small businesses and they all use it from instructors like me for an event to coaches and financial advisors.","I can't complain about this software as it is free. Maybe I might if I were paying on using it at a different user level, but it's such a nice tool for a small business to promote events.

I was a littlw hesitant to use Eventbrite at first because it would take thw customer away from my webpage but the customisation options allowed me to really focus on making my events personal to my busibess. I would get updates the instant someone signed up for an event or a sale that I promoted with EventBrite. They offer an outstanding product and will use them again in the near future,I do not have too much bad to say about EventBrite other then the customer has to leave my page in order to go to the event page. I wish there was an integrated wigit I could use to bring Eventbrite to my social media platforms,Im trying to bring customers together and get them excited about what we have to offer.

Eventbrite is giving us almost all of the same features without the huge price tag. We can customize the questions so we can easily gather all of the information we need from each attendee. We can schedule reminders to attendees and those who still need to register. We can have all the information we need about attendees and track any changes they make to their registrations in one place. We also used eventbrite to sell tickets for a concert we held last year and it was fantastic. Easy for ticket buyers and we were able to pull lists for the concert that made guest check- in a snap.","If your event is not a ticketed event it does require more thought and planning to make eventbrite work.

There are a LOT of great features but the cost absolutely can't be beat. Other apps/programs/software have so many added fees for random features that it becomes an expensive hassle to even hold a single event. Not so with Eventbrite. We'd been burnt before with all the little hidden fees that it took some convincing the higher ups to get on board with Eventbrite. Now? They love it. Haven't looked back. It's an easy, hassle-free way to send out mass invites for an exceptional price. Just pump the link into an email and you're good to go. You can even have customizeable discounts and promo codes. I can keep going but I'll save you the reading. If you're using a different event planner, switch over. You'll get glad you did.","I don't like fishing for cons when there aren't any readily apparent, but if I had to say one negative thing about Eventbrite, it would be the customer service. You'll rarely have need to get in contact with them, but when you do it'll be a struggle. A few more reps, some more training, and an overall cheerier disposition would do them wonders.",,,

Their template works for almost an function and navigating is fairly intuitive. Many people are familiar with Eventbrite so they're willing to go through the step of clicking into an additional link after reading about the event via social media or email.,"The customizations options are limited. There are not enough options to ask additional questions or gain event related information from the user. The backend data is not easy to access, use or transfer into other applications. While they are cost effective for small organizations, don't be fooled. The fees add up quick. Their per ticket cost is reasonable, but their credit card processing fees are high per industry average.","When it comes to the simple process of creating a ticketed and/or registered event, it can be done simply and quickly with Eventbrite. Customer service is quick to answer questions via chat or email. It does have limitations; however, without paying a subscription cost, it is still an industry leading tool.",,
3805,eventbrite,I would not recommend Eventbrite,Mary Lee C.,Writer and Editor,,2+ years,NGC,Capterra,2019-06-20,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,9.0,,"While I do not actually like anything about this software itself, I do like that, although with considerable difficulty, it enables me to book online for events. I simply wish that events would use different software in order to achieve the same end result of allowing booking online.","I find this software unwelcoming and overly complicated to achieve a seemingly simplistic task. It is even difficult to sign in, and I am rarely sure, even after receiving a confirmation e-mail if I have booked correctly. As a result, I regularly waste time calling the event venue the next day, if a number is provided, to check that all details have been accurately received, and often (not always, but more frequently than I regard as reasonable), despite having received a confirmation e-mail, had I not checked with the venue, I was not booked into the event, which for events with limited space is, of course, potentially especially problematic. As a culture writer, attending arts events is an important aspect of my job, and it is a great time waster and strain whenever an event is done entirely through Eventbrite, as I must check anything possible and still be nervous that I will have trouble attending a sometimes necessary event.","My experience of Eventbrite has been very poor. It adds a great deal of time and worry to my working day whenever I have to use Eventbrite and follow up on it. Whenever possible, I avoid Eventbrite, and I have found that with some events and venues, while Eventbrite claims there is no availability, if one is able to circumvent Eventbrite and book directly, there is availability, so Eventbrite often seems a useless, even frustrating and counterproductive, unnecessary 'middle man.' I have had so many variedly negative experiences with Eventbrite, that recently, I decided for events that only book through it, if the event can be missed, it is more productive to not attend the event than deal with Eventbrite.",,

They make it beyond simple to create, manage, take payment, check-in attendees in their app, and receive payment. Even things that seem tricky like adding waivers to tickets and adding custom fields for additional data are extremely simple to use and access. Basically, everything just works as expected.","Now, with great software, I understand does come a price. However while their fee structure has changed over the years, I still maintain they are taking too large a cut of ticket sales. While the exact percentage does change based on your plan and the price of the ticket you're selling, we consistently see 30% or more of our ticket sales revenue go to to Eventbrite. Again I do understand that you do need to pay for great software, I just wish Eventbrite either took a lower percentage or offered a flat fee option.","Overall we are extremely satisfied with Eventbrite. Yes, I think their fees are too high, but in terms of actual functionality, Eventbrite pretty much does everything we need it to do extremely well.",,

I have found that allowing access to current location can trigger the app to run in the background of you mobile device.

For example, you can set special ticket type, make tickets available or unavailable at specific times/dates, set promo codes for speakers or discounts (e.g. for students). Payment processing is done by Eventbrite and then transferred electronically to an account you indicate. Fees are quite low and easily incorporated into ticket price (which you can choose to be visible or not to the end user). Very intuitive.

Besides the required 'ease of use' and 'intuitive design' of their site I have to honestly say that I like all the controls the platform gives me. I can easily create different ticket options, discount codes, tracking links, invitations (which also allow me to invite attendees of previous events I've hosted on the platform) and can manually add any users (such as comp tickets for media) to the system without incurring any fees. I can also easily repeat an event with one click, which saves any custom tickets or pricing and also allows for easy updates. Their integration with social media is helpful, and they are always making updates to their offerings. They also have promotional tools to help you reach an audience outside of your usual base. The nonprofit organization I work for has conducted over 70 parties, tours, classes, etc with Eventbrite, and I consider them a partner in helping us produce great events and helping me raise money for our educational programs. I also appreciate that they are growing as a company. I never feel that their 'resting on their laurels' when it comes to the design of the site or the tools offered. Even after working with them for a number of years, I still call tech support to get questions answered if I can't figure it out quickly on my own, and their staff is helpful and nice. All in all I give them an A+. They make my job easier, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for an online ticketing company.",,,,,

Since it's a ticket, some advanced options are not available. One problem we run into is that we apply discount codes. If you apply a 100% discount code (someone gets to attend for free, happens all the time), it will cancel the ticket!

Everything from tickets to itinerary listings, it does reliably and comfortably. It's easy to use for most people who are not tech savvy, while giving some power users some settings to tweak with regards to reminders and ticket/voucher organization (Apple Wallet, etc).","You might only use Eventbrite a few times a year, but it doesn't stop it from trying to invade your ecosystem with integrations and email subscription.

Good Support.

Front Side simplicity and intuitive user friendly GUI that even our Senior/Non-tech savvy customers can use easily.","Some changes are slow and others happen like lightening- it makes for a bumpy ride at times, and soft/whiney employees can have a hard time dealing with the changes or lack there of.

The system does not have a simplistic, intuitive, or as yet, reliable accounting system to integrate into our bookkeeping or payroll- though I am told this maybe coming.","been using this product for over 4 years now- and we have had in grow with our business. In the beginning we were using home made database that was very specifically engineered to our needs, but wasn't capable (because of its age) of taking online reservations. We integrated the basic online component of Betterez into our system with a high degree of extra effort on our customer support staff side. Eventually we changed our in-house system and policies and made the move over to a Full Time Betterez system; this change was a little rough in the beginning but we received great support from the Betterez team and it worked out well. Now almost 5 years later we are still reaping the benefits of an up to date, supported, and growing reservation system. It has been wonderful to be a part of the development of the Betterez system.","This has been a successful, customer friendly and positive system for our needs. I had looked into using interline reservation system with Greyhound and or Amtrak, but this was a much better choice for someone being focused on positive customer service experience.",

We had books to keep track of passengers and availability and paper everywhere. We tried to have custom reservation platform built and it was an expensive lesson that did not even get off the ground. I got introduced to Betterez and had several conversations with their reps. I could not believe how much time these guys dedicated to me and my little company. Still, to this day, they both take a personal interest in what is going on and how we are making out with the program. Anytime I have a thought or request for a change, they listen and ask questions. Betterez is very simple to use and get onto using. I love that it is cloud-based, I can log in anywhere in the world from my phone or tablet. We very recently launched our online purchasing through our website, this is helping us provide our customers with another easy and safe method to check the availability of seats and to buy tickets.

They have constantly improved in every aspect, from the product to their customer service, with an organized vision for future enhancements that seems to be largely based on the requests of their customers. Similar services have tried to convert us over the years to their product, but when stacked up next to Betterez, they've all fallen short.

He was readily available to answer any questions from our staff as well as customers buying tickets to our performances. In addition, he was at every one of our performances assisting patrons and selling additional tickets. He is a gem. Our organization surveyed our families that were involved in our production and the overall satisfaction rate using the online ticketing system was superior. The convenience and easy process to purchase tickets was very much appreciated. The bonus of being able to select their own seats and print tickets from home was mentioned most from our families as to why they loved using this software. Not only was the use of the software and online process advantageous but assisted us with timing of performances as well over 90% of tickets were purchased in advance so there were no long lines at the box office on performance days. My organization cannot recommend MyBoxOffice enough. We will certainly be using them again not only for our Nutcracker season but other upcoming performances as well.","The fees for online ticketing and credit card processing are low and get charged to the customer, so we, as a non-profit, don't lose out a percentage of every ticket.

It has jumped us into the 21st century by allowing us to offer online ticket sales! Wintix has enabled us to streamline the way we store all of our box office information and has eliminated the need for other software programs that we had been using to track our sales (Quicken, primarily), keep customer records and print tickets. We have been able to customize the program to our unique situation of selling flex season passes where passholders then reserve seats for each performance individually. We have a small house of 166 seats, but this software has made our job so much easier and less time consuming in handling tickets, payments, reservations, etc. The tech support is wonderful and has been so beneficial to a box office manager that is just tech savvy enough to by... yet has been able to make the switch without any trouble! OK, well I've made a couple of panicked phone calls, ha, ha. Ultimately, the online sales capability is taking a lot of pressure off of our box office and our patrons are making the switch to find it very convenient. We still provide limited box office hours to serve the less adventurous.","Ease of use, seamless switch over from Wintix 5 to Wintix 6 with Webtix, fantastic staff to solve issues, custom programming if necessary.

We also use it for year-long educational programs, specialty shows, fundraising events and theater tours, concessions, etc. It is highly flexible. We use it to track 100% of all cash receipts. You simply set up a show to be any category of receipts such as tuition, show deposit refunds, liquor concessions. For non-show events we use the option to not use a seating chart. It's also great for Flex Pass season subscriptions where patrons don't use a series such as 3rd Friday of each show.

My only complaint would really be aesthetics,"Our company made the scary choice to move into Wintix 6/Webtix some time ago. Within no time at all we knew we made the best choice and the web orders came flowing into Wintix 6 with virtually no effort from our staff. Within less than a month, we booked over $26K in effortless sales. It works beautifully! We're thrilled (although we know we came to this a little late)! We also opted for some custom programming to accommodate student registrations for CampTMP and a personalized seating chart.
