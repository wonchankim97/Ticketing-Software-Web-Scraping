# Ticketing Software Web Scraping

There are many different types of ticketing software that have sprung up in the past decade. However, with this project, after coming across the [Capterra](https://www.capterra.com), I wanted to focus on ticketing softwares that dealt with merchants who had to find a platform in order to sell tickets to their events.

These merchants pay the ticketing software company varying fees, such as a percentage of a ticket or a fixed deduction from each ticket sale. However, although these metrics can be used to try to deduce how a company should structure their business flow, I was more interested in the customer (merchants) reviews for each of the softwares.

Take a look at the blog for more details: [Scraping Ticketing Software Reviews](https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/ticketing-software-reviews/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

In order to run the files, make sure to have the following libraries:
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
* [Numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Seaborn](https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/download/)

Then, clone this repository into your local machine and try manipulating the driver yourself!
```
git clone https://github.com/wonchankim97/House-Price-Prediction
```

## Further Improvements

I would like to go deeper into the NLP side of this project. Once I have a better understanding of deep learning, I wish to utilize other more powerful engines of NLP to provide deeper insights into my data. Also, if there are any other sites that display reviews such as Capterra for ticketing companies, there could be other scripts implemented to scrape them in order to see different perspectives of various companies in this industry.
