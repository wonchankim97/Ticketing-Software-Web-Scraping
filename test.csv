0,tix,Tix Cares! *Best ticketing Company...Bar none.,Beatriz B.,Marketing Coordinator,"Gambling & Casinos, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,2019-02-20,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,Pros: Customer service is the BEST! No words can describe the amazing service Tix provides.,"Cons: Not many people know about Tix. If more people knew, Tix would be the #1 ticketing system in the world!","Overall: I had no background on ticketing systems, Tix manager took me under his wing and now I can create events in minutes. Our reo gives a personalized customer service, based on your company's needs. He's patient and he has a great team, he's the very definition of a good manager. Experiencing a big ticketing company right now and it's disappointing of how poor the training and the customer service is. when you think of a big corporation you think they'll have and provide all tools needed to succeed. In reality, they care about the high fees and selling but not caring how it gets done. Tix cares about the success on both parties and they care about customers providing low fees. Each account is a priority to Tix, they help as much as they can. To a big company, 1 account is nothing, and they make you do the job for them. Tix also cares when creating a new venue map, their team must be geniuses because all I have to do is send them a PDF and they do the rest (at no cost), at the same time they let you know if something doesn't look right of if you missed a row or a seat number. They've saved me from a few mistakes and embarrassment, instead they help me succeed and look good to my superiors. If you're looking for a ticketing company Tix is the right choice. No question is stupid or not important to our rep, he never acts like he is too good to answer he never makes you call the appropriate person to help you, if you have an issue he's there. Thank you!",

2,tix,TIX is the answer we needed--Great support and patron experience,Jennifer E.,Data Systems Coordinator,"Religious Institutions, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,2016-10-13,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,Pros: Patron experience is excellent. Help library is great. Customer support is excellent.,"Cons: Sometimes the reports do not output to excel correctly, but the developer said this is a known issue and is being resolved.","Overall: We wanted an easy-to-use system where patrons could select their own seats for events in a 1500-seat venue and our smaller 450-seat theater. Going from our old paper system to TIX was a great decision. We were looking for a reasonable fee structure and solid customer support--TIX has both. Another feature that was important for us was to be able to hide the fee for certain events and TIX makes that easy to do. Sales reports, customer data and back-end management are easy to use and the TIX help library is excellent--anything I have not been able to figure out has been quickly responded to from TIX support via phone or email. I've also been impressed by the personal rapport of my support specialist--when I call, she knows who I am and is familiar with our organization's venues and events. I'm sure she has many clients to attend to, but I have had excellent response to each call or email--always within the same day!

Many of our patrons are older and I have heard nothing but positive responses from those who have attempted to make online purchases through TIX. We have some who call or walk in for a ""box office"" experience, and those orders are easily handled. Since our TIX site is branded to look like our own website, many purchasers do not even recognize they have left our website to make their purchase.

TIX is exactly what we were looking for.",

While there are some glitches, overall the system is simple to use and the Customer Service is outstanding! They have enabled me to streamline processes that were consuming more time than humanly endurable with the automatic renewal system. They advise me of the system parameters and what it can do for me, and have educated me to use it proficiently throughout the years. They take ownership of my problems and resolve them by whatever it takes to get the job done, including being most accommodating customizing reports, seat maps, customer letters, emails, etc. as needed and adapting their programming to meet my unique needs, a rare option in this world! I have never experienced more concern for my issues and dedication to resolving them than I have with this staff of experts. They continually enhance and improve their system and incorporate my requests whenever possible. They are truly committed to excellence going above and beyond providing extraordinary Customer Service and are quick to respond to my often urgent needs and resolved issues I deemed hopeless. They listen to my problems, have eased my frustrations and spent hours and hours on the phone with me and my complications over the years. I have worked with other systems that had no one to talk with and no ""phone a friend"" option which I found unbearable. Although I have never met any of the staff, I regard them as my friends as I am the friend in need and they are the friends indeed!",,,,

As a service provider, when it came time to determine what system to use for printing tickets and tracking customer support issues, I knew there were a lot of choices. I looked into ticketing systems I have used in the past that require a lot of support and local maintenance and found a few light weight systems that I could install myself. Since coming on board in 2008, Tix.com has been n amazing support system for our company.

These days, I try modeling our own support after Tix. com's. The service is great, the product is awesome, and they have an extensive help center to help answer any questions. The ticketing service itself is intuitive and easy to use. Would definitely recommend it!. It's very convenient and we now have the right tool to support our guests.",,,,

There are a lot of minor but important steps that you have to really know when you are setting up an event prior to activating to the public. The menu selection, description, and navigation is not clear cut and I find myself jumping around to find things. There are also a lot of menu selections that can be consolidated. We are probably only using 15% of the functions that you offer and the rest are repetitive. I am a software developer myself so I have a slight idea on what I am talking about :)",,,,

She was always easy to get a hold of and offered detailed help both to assist and enable to do it oneself. This was a much better experience when we were switched to be under her care and management.

I find the layout of Tix to be difficult to learn from the back end, and still find myself searching for certain functions even after using it for two events now. This could be more user friendly/intuitive for those who aren't used to these type of systems.

Love all the different options with Tix, with so many variables for surveys, donations, coupon codes, etc. There is so much you can do with your event which is very helpful for complex events.

Overall very happy with Tix and glad we chose to go with them again for our second event.",,,,

I'm a reader and generally very adapt with new software and I struggled to navigate the system for the first time. I required a lot of customer support, which was excellent, its just a burden to ask 50 questions to accomplish one task. It might have been nice to see a tutorial video to lessen the excessive amount of hand holding for newbies. Now that I understand the system, it's a piece of cake, the beginning was rough.

To set up an event, one simply clicks through the pages inserting production information and then it's finished. If there are modification, that is easily done by clicking on ""modify event"". An instruction video along with tabs and menus walk one through the steps and tech support always has a real person available, not automation.","Cons: Our company is in North Carolina and Tix.com is in California. The time difference is the only issue, but even with that, there is an emergency number so support is always available.","Overall: Simplicity of use, affordable price and consistent tech support.",

We didn't make proper use of the bar code on the tickets.,Overall: This is the first time I have used a program like this. I had looked for one in the past for another business I am involved in but the costs were too high. This product is very affordable for smaller productions and events such as ours.

Patti has been outstanding and always eager to help with any issue that may arise. I would like to see more youtube videos how to operate analytic for Tix. I don't use the analytics that often and could refer to a youtube video to refresh my memory. The report I use most often is pulling concert attendees and inserting their email address into MailChimp.

I have been using the software for the past three years for the Westside Ballet of Santa Monica's two annual productions. It is very easy to use as an event manager and the customer service response when I have questions is prompt and helpful. The ticket production is efficient.

The versatility offered by the AudienceView platform makes it good solution for Arts, Athletics, and Academic ticketing needs, as well as more complex ticketing events such as large-scale concerts, commencement ceremonies, and even film festivals. The built-in correspondence tool is a strong component of the product offering and is something my organization has come to rely on. It has allowed us to develop a more frequent, targeted relationship with our customers through-out the ticketing experience. It also works in unison with the membership tool, which can be configured to handle our subscriptions, memberships, ticket passes/packages, and more. Once our guests have enjoyed the event we're presenting, the software has a diverse set of reporting tools that can isolate and refine our data - the sky is the limit. One last important tool to note is the online content management tool. We operate multiple white-label branded websites from the system with ease.",,,,

144,gesture,Amazing Product,Brandi G.,Office Manager,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2019-01-09,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,9.0,,"Pros:

We were looking for an affordable and easy to use mobile bidding auction program and this one did not disappoint. The company sends a representative to the auction to basically be the point person and fix anything that might come up and help with check in, entering data, etc. They show up early and stay through the event. They bring tablets that are easy to use for our volunteers and staff.

Entering items and bidders is easy and functional. Your event can go live as soon as you'd like it to so that even donors that can't attend the night of, can bid on items. This increases revenue tremendously. They also helped us with not having small items but focusing on larger items of value and only having around 100-150 silent items. The colorful pictures and descriptions are easy to view on mobile devices. And if guests don't have a smart phone, we can help them bid on our tablets.

Guests receive notification of being outbid, but you can add am amount you are willing to pay and Gesture will continue bidding on your behalf until the amount is reached.

Guests are also able to check out from their device, so it makes check out a lot faster and smoother.

It is a lot easier to collect on balances as well because we collect credit card information before the event.

Guests received notification of being outbid, but you can add am amount you are willing to pay and Gesture will continue bidding on your behalf until the amount is reached.","Cons: If the tablets go down at check in, it pretty much puts everything at a stand still. Even though the tablets run without wi-fi.","Overall: Most of our donors and guests loved the new aspect of our Auction, including switching to mobile bidding/checking in and out. Instead of the previous years of pen and paper bidding. There were only a few people that preferred the old method and just couldn't seem to get on bored. People were concerned that guests would be on their phones all night and no one would be interacting but it was quite the opposite. People had more time to mingle not having to go back and check the paper bid sheets since there were none.",

It's intuitive and easy to navigate. It makes my job as an event manager much easier. Adding auction items, auction close out, and financial reporting are a breeze. It is also a smooth process for our guests. Bidding on auction items or making a donation is very easy for them, which means more donations for our cause. We set up our auction online in advance of the event. This gives guests an opportunity to start bidding on silent items, and become familiar with live auction items. All of this leads to more revenue to support our mission. I also appreciate the ability to customize our site so it looks like us. This creates a cohesive experience for our guests and helps us put our brand front and center. As a site administrator, I love the ability to download the generated auction sheets. This is a huge time saver. We also download the receipts and send to guests with a thank you letter after the event. It calculates the tax deductibility automatically on the receipt which is an essential feature.","Cons: There are a few custom queries/reports I would like which are not currently offered. It can be confusing as an admin to see clearly what funds have been paid and not paid. However, the staff are great and have helped me figure things out. They even created a custom report for me.",,

Bidders loved how easy it was to register for the silent auction, and we benefitted greatly from launching the website and opening the auction prior to the event. There were many easy tutorials for our volunteers to watch so that they could get comfortable with the online bidding system, and they were well equipped to handle questions from guests. We benefitted greatly from having an onsite specialist with us at the event. She was extremely professional, smart, highly capable and knowledgeable about the software, and she worked nimbly and confidently throughout the night to answer any questions and even offered suggestions that contributed significantly to the success of our auction - and on top of that, she was very enjoyable to be with! After the event, we were able to easily close our books and to process all payments (a significant improvement from many years of dealing with cash and checks and tracking down payments) and to run reports providing incredible data for us to review and learn from.",Cons: I cannot think of anything to improve this software. It was perfect for our event - simple to use and very geared toward serving a volunteer-based event!,"Overall: Streamlined auction process before, during and after event. We went ""paperless"" and didn't have to fuss with paper bidding forms and associated headaches. We raised more than $10,000 more than we ever raised before using an online bidding system. We look forward to using again next year!",

Bidders receive texts when they have been outbidded. You are able to create endless silent and live auction items for your page. Event support is so responsive and you are able to customize your support needs for in state and out of state events. Their team arrive to your event with ipads to complete donor bidder profiles on site. They will come to your booth in exhibit hall and encourage people to register for bidding. They are super friendly and outgoing and are great as live auction spotters. They raise far more than their cost and double our giving. You are able to even enter in different pledge amounts as donation items on the auction site.,"Cons: They are a little costly however it's worth it for a smooth, successful event. I do wish the website was a little more attractive and grouped the silent and live items together. The items appear kind of small and cramped together.",Overall: GiveSmart provides much needed day of event support as well as an easy to use interface for auction bidding. Reporting has helped ease the closeout process and assure everyone receives their items and we receive payment. They send continuous follow-up to donors for payment post event. You also have access to crowdfunding for 6 months after your event has ended.,

Features offered have improved each year we have contracted with Givesmart. ""One stop shopping"" for event and auction management. We have utilized more features each year. What started as just utilizing auction management capability with limited effort into making the online auction site attractive has evolved to guest ticketing, table assignments, a highly customized auction site that reflects the event theme and with real time auction progress and bids scrolling on large screen ad televisions throughout the event venue to increase people's competitive bidding nature. After action information has been vital to determining what auction items had the most interests and highest profit margin. Has enabled us to better focus solicitation efforts for the next year.",Cons: Really very few cons for the software. Only limitation observed was limited printing options for auction item description for printing on card stock. There needs to be several options for the size and information/photo of the descriptive card tents.,Overall: Nearly full event management by using this software.,

I thoroughly appreciate Gesture's frequent software updates. They are continuously in search of even better ways to improve upon the customer experience, which they communicate through their Gesture Innovation Center emails. I believe that they value customer opinions and implement suggestions, accordingly. As an event planner, other companies often approach me, but none offer the experience Gesture has given my clients over the years. Our account manager, Allie Erickson is on top of our every need, patient, accessible, friendly and helpful. Our on-site manager is thoughtful, communicative, professional and kind. The Gesture team is trustworthy, diligent and fully dedicated to their customers. Every year, our attendees highly rate Gesture in our post-event survey. We have remained loyal to Gesture for many years and will continue for many more to come.","Cons: I would like to remain logged onto the system longer, but I understand that the system logs me off for security purposes.

The transition from paper building to mobile has drastically increased our pre-event and day of event fundraising. My favorite part about the software is the increase in funds collected the night of the event. It was incredibly unfortunately how much staff time we had to dedicate post event to collecting money, for many of our events we not have 100% funds collected the night of the event, which frees our staff up to focus on thanking donors. Lastly, the interface is very easy to understand and navigate. We have a number of events that have more mature attendees, who were skeptical when we began to make the transition from paper to electronic. After one use they all required we use the technology at future events. This is also a credit to the Gesture onsite staff who really meet the attendees where they are at and give extra attention when needed!","Cons: I guess my comments would be both a pro and a con. The fact that Gesture is constantly evolving and improving the technology it can sometimes be hard to keep up with all of the current offerings and capabilities as a client. This is one of many vendors you work with so it can be hard to keep yourself educated. Although, this is when you really rely on your account manager to relay this information to you, which our, representtaive, does a wonderful job.",,

I also really like the ease in which bidders can participate, get alerts, and have knowledge of their purchases. Finally, the added bonus of a PR team to work with was an extra perk I was not expecting!","Cons: There are certain gaps in the software we have discovered such as: Nowhere to record solicitors such as staff, committee, or Board member who was responsible for bringing in the item; Nowhere to record an individual's name associated with a company in donor details; Nowhere to record details for pledged item, such as when it will be delivered, staff pick-up needs, etc.; Need to have ability to check box if donor has already received thank you for their contributions (such as when it went unsold at a past event and is being used again); Non-transferrable input from one event to another such as donor information. I also have major concerns over the software abilities to capture donations during the ask. There is simply no way to ensure those that raise their hands, are actually hitting the button to donate that is texted to them.","Overall: During this first year in using the software, I saw the additional benefit of securing bids in advance of opening the auction. This started us out thousands of dollars ahead of where we would have traditionally began at the event.",

I am new to the website and it only took me about an hour to figure everything out. Everything is pretty self explanatory. I had to create an auction site for a silent and live auction. Adding each item came with ease. When you go to add an item each section is categorized telling you exactly what information to put in. I also found it very easy to go back and change things if I had made a mistake. The site is easy for others to use and view the auction items I posted. I felt that the crowd we were trying to attract was the older generation of people and this site allowed them to have the ability to see each item without complication. I really liked that the software told you who was watching certain items. It was easy to generate an item sheet in order to print them out and post them for our auction.,Cons: I think my least favorite thing about this software is trying to figure out when someone bids higher than you and who it is. I found that I had trouble when I bid on an item. My friend and I really wanted an item and we kept out bidding each other but didn't realize we were the only two bidding. I wish it would tell you who is bidding against yo.,Overall: I had a wonderful experience with this software. I found it was easy to make my own auction site.,

It's a fantastic tool for mobile bidding at auctions and overall ""day-of-event"" fundraising. Easy to use and navigate. In addition to the software, you get actual people that run the software the day of the event.","Cons: One challenge I have found is that the information from last year's event doesn't carry over to the next year. Since we typically get a lot of the same donors, I have to re-enter donors from scratch instead of having the system ""remember"" them from last year.","Overall: Good overall experience, we will use them again next year. Custom service for the software is very responsive. Most of the people they send to the event are very polite and professional, but we have had a couple of people that have not been the best at representing our organization.",

The spreadsheets can be sorted as you like for your purposes. I also like the messaging. You can send out text messages to your guests for reminders like auction open for bidding, parking, auction closing, links to photos post event, etc. You can also generate tax letters from the site. A lot of great features!","Cons: The only thing I wish it could do is generate tax letters for each guest separately. If you need to make a change for one guest, you have to generate all letters as they go into a single PDF file. You can't just generate them for one guest. Not a major problem, just wish it was a feature. Overall it is a great system!","Overall: I have been able to generate reports that I need for sharing with my committee and for tax letters. Also, the on-line bidding system is a favorite of our guests. I love the messaging too. It allows me to send messages to my guests pre, during, and post event.",

The organizations has utilized GiveSmart for 4 years and has never had an issue. When they assign an event representative to you, you can be assured that any question you may have in setting up the auction site or any technical problems that you may have will be resolved immediately by the assigned rep or they will ensure that they find the right person to correct the issue or answer the question if they cannot immediately help. In addition to the auction management, their pacakge allows for FULL event management; everything from","Cons: Cost of using the service would be the only negative, and not really a negative because their costs are actually lower than some other options that the organization looked into.","Overall: Cannot sing their praises more. If you want to go with a group that honestly cares about wanting to make your event a success, use GiveSmart.",

The staff from gestures that helped during the event was knowledgeable and able to help and respond quickly and effectively during the event went on which made it less chaotic feeling for us.","Pros: I love that gesture was easy for our guests to use at our gala. We used it for check in and the process was simple and easy to understand for our volunteers at registration to find info. We used it for our silent auction and guests were able to see the items from their phones and bid very easily and they received notices when they were outbid or when they won. We used it for general donations, selling centerpieces, and checkout. Overall pretty easy to use during the event.","Cons: During the check in process we were unable to search by table number which would have been helpful because sometimes we are asked who is sitting at a certain table and it would be nice to look up by table. Also after the event we needed specific reports to be able to input all of the money we received and record all of the info and gestures did not yet have one comprehensive report to give us what we needed, instead I had to modify and combine several reports to make it work for our needs.",,

We also enjoyed the categories options for items and the ease of creating and managing the tickets portal.",Cons: Some of the features like not being able to manage donations made pre-event and the donation thermometer is lack luster. We went from doing a paddle raise to doing all mobile donations and did not feel the thermometer display was as exciting or captured the attention of guests. We did not realize until the night of the event that in order to show progress in the thermometer we had to keep refreshing the page. Just not what we were expecting.,"Overall: Ease of ticket sales and managing all of our fundraising items including silent auction, games, and donations.",

We like the auction capabilities and simplicity of use. We like that Gesture makes enhancements and improvements based on user feedback. We like the ability to use the helpdesk chat function when we have a question. We like the dashboard and reports. Unrelated to software , but a nice customer service perk is that you have a rep designated to you.","Cons: A few improvements can be made (as with any software) and when I suggest them, they are escalated.

I have been very pleased over the years and plan to continue to use Gesture.",Overall: I have recommended this product to quite a few non profits for the ease of use and the fact that it combines several event planning tasks into one platform.,

The reporting functionality is fantastic and I love being able to see results in real time.","Cons: 1. I wish we could have several screens for the same item. Silent Auction packages are sometimes made up of a few items and it would be nice to showcase those items visually on more than one available page.

2. Similarly, the automated process of creating table tents/placards for your project is not ideal. The available space for an image is too small, as is font size. You don't want people squinting at your package descriptions.",Overall: Ease of use and real time results. Also having GiveSmart employees at the event.,

It's incredibly motivating to see our progress as the event unfolds. We also can compare last year's dashboard to this years and know where we need to step it up. The second best feature are the sponsor ads. We like how they are not only on the homepage but integrated through the software.,"Cons: Limited design capability and limited selection on display board that we used for Fund the Need. We thought sponsors names would appear after they hit the donate button, but names kept coming alphabetically.",Overall: Great tracking of donors and donations; an easy and effective platform to highlight sponsors of our event; a great summary of our night.,

Also, inputting registrants who pay with a check. Honestly, just about everything or we would not have used Gesture for a second time. Support was fantastic!","Cons: Online Help! Difficult to navigate when in a hurry, too many screens to go through, need to print help or have a download capability such as a User Manual especially for new people. This might seem trite but the blue ""Help"" button is in the way when trying to work with a list or read a screen. Keep it at the top and turn it blue.

We LOVE our account rep - she is super responsive. The folks that come out to work the auction are always wonderful too. The extra staff support is essential to our event! I also think the interface is very user-friendly and not overly complicated.,"Cons: I wish there were an easier way to do a mass photo upload for items, and I wish that items said SOLD instead of CLOSED when they are purchased outright, and that they said NOT OPEN FOR BIDDING if they are something being auctioned in the future.",Overall: It makes my online auction much easier.,

There are lots of reports available for the client as well.","Cons: There are some needed features that myself and my colleagues have requested, such as: ability to check in 2 guests at once, easier way to add credit card to guests that are already checked it, etc. Hopefully these features will be rolled out soon.",,

From an adminstrator perspective, entering items is user-friendly, the software takes much of the manual work outu of your auction and the Gesture team makes sure you're supported throughout the whole process.

The fact that there is a website that allows ANYONE to bid on auction items widens our bandwidth and allows for a much higher return. Additionally, the customer service is always impeccable.

The post event reporting gives us a great picture of our donors so that we can continue to make changes and adapt our events so we can raise as much money as possible.,"Cons: It would be extremely beneficial to have mailing address required on all elements of the site. Mailing address is crucial to us in order to thank our donors appropriately. This year, the Give Smart team worked with us to help us collect addresses when our guests were registering for the auction online the week leading up to the event, but we would love to see mailing address as a required field for the registration process also.",,

Making the daily work load so much less than it was.

We use SyAM for asset management , one benefit is that is has taken away the task of touching each machine to grab the mac address for MAC authentication. We just run a report and grab it from the SyAM asset management application. It also helps us with our yearly inventory report that needs to be presented to the BOE.

We use SyAM for our MDM - by using SyAM we touch the machines once when they come in and then we never see them again unless the screen breaks.

We use SyAM for our ticketing system. We had a reduction in staff this year and the ticketing system has been amazing. When a ticket is created - it is sent out to the techs and they are able to respond in a reasonable time, making everyone happy. I am so glad we have this system.

The support from SyAM is fantastic. I have never been disappointed.",Cons: I would like to clean up the ticketing system so it flows better for the end user. I am pretty sure this is on my end not SyAM. I can't really think of anything that we do not like about the software.,Overall: It has been exceptional!,

The customization level is decent and the support from the company staff has been amazing. Someone is always a phone call away and willing to explain or remote into the system. Their support documentation is also very detailed which makes it easy to follow along with steps to something you are unfamiliar with.,"Cons: The cons that I have about this software seem to all be items SyAM is working on, which is nice. The MDM system currently does not allow assignment based on ID's like some other systems. Currently the helpdesk system is not integrated with Google SSO sign in for our organization, which does not allow us to use the helpdesk end-user portal. In the future they say this will be possible and we are very much looking forward to it!","Overall: SyAM has been a good solution for us this last year.

The company I worked for owned an aquarium, tour boat, banquet hall and an exhibition center. I used this software to create group reservations and to check-in groups upon arrival. This software worked very well for the general admission process and the point of sale terminals in the gift shop and the cafe. The yearly gift shop inventory process went smoothly using this software. The company also sent someone to our location to help us get acclimated to the new system.","Cons: Personally, I had two main problems with this software. The first problem involved the creation of group visits, we had previously been able to create a group account for a group that was a repeat visitor. Once the account was created, you could pull up the account and view the organization's history of visiting the aquarium. We no longer had this option with Gatemaster. Each visit was a desperate entity and this caused difficulties when billing groups with multiple visits; that required one invoice sent to their corporate office.

The second problem involved combination tickets. The combination tickets included visits to both the aquarium and the tour boat or the aquarium and the exhibition center. I would create daily attendance reports which became problematic with Gatemaster because the software was always double counting the attendance on the combination tickets. If a person purchased a combination ticket, the computer counted it as two people visiting not one. We were unable to separate the combination attendance from the admission only attendance. This aspect of Gatemaster was extremely frustrating and it was impossible to get accurate attendance numbers.",Overall: The product works well if it suits your business exactly as created. The problems occur if and when you need to customize the software to suit your needs. It is very difficult to change or modify this software. If you need this product for basic point of sales processing you should be fine.,

Support is some of the best we have ever had always an easy phone call away and they typically remote in and help us understand our questions with hands-on demonstrations.

Everyone here loves it from frontline staff to accounting to management it has made all of our lives easier. The purchase process was easy and the Gatemaster staff was so helpful in helping us figure out what we needed.

I've told them more than once they should start a sideline to teach other companies how to run their service and support departments.

I contacted Gatemaster to see what we could do to get updated and get our PoS running smoothly again. I was pleasantly surprised when the told me that for a small fee that would not only help me reinstall that software but also update us to their most recent version. I purchased that hardware myself and spent about a week on the phone with the tech support getting everything working again. I can't say enough about the hospitality of the tech support staff.

Now Mr. Joe Ross , VP of GM blocked me out of the ticket support too unless I pay $1,250 first. So much for service to existing clients. We are in the process of franchising out our business.

Too many steps. At this point, with the number of events I have created, it should take less than 5 minutes to set up.

Loading images and getting them to the right size, resolution and added steps to update everytime you make change.

Recommendation would be to allow companies to set up a template and only have to fill in changes to the actual event OR fix Cloning. Whenever I use the Cloning feature, there is always issues that don't make sense.","Overall: We are a smaller venue and on-line ticket sales are primarily a convenience for customers within the local area. In my opinion, the overall function and ease of use, could be more streamlined to reduce some of the reduncancy when creating an event. I would consider myself above average on a technical level, but there seems to be tedious issues, requiring me to ask for assistance whenever I am creating an event. Having said that, the support we receive from Gary Bradshaw and his quick response at resolving any problems, is excellent. We have not tried other ticketing agencies because of the level of customer service we receive.

To be fair, I have never used another ticketing agent, so I have nothing to compare it to. The reason for 3 Star on Ease of Use is because, while not complicated, it can be tedious and more time consuming than I believe it should.

Having been in business for a long time, even if a particular product or service is slightly higher in cost or slightly lower in quality, it is well worth it when customer service is above reproach.",

They're very helpful in answering questions, adding tickets, verifying ticket refunds, etc... They were awesome from start to finish!

The afternoon of the concert, I printed out our list of attendees to give to those checking in our guests at the front door. The only glitch we had, there were 8-10 ticket holders that when they presented their tickets, it only had their first name. So we asked for their last name, thinking it was probably just a printing area, but the last name was still not on the attendee list. What we soon figured out was with these 8-10 tickets, was their first name was on the attendee list as both their first and last names. For example, Ticket holder #125, order ID 1419943, was listed on the attendee list as Keri Keri.

328,sap_event_ticketing,SAP's platform for the future,Verified Reviewer,Bookkeeper,,Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-04-08,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,10.0,,"Pros: Started using HANA 5 years ago with v1 SPS5 back when it was just released for SAP BW. Back then it was ""only"" an in-memory DB. With each new SPS release, HANA became better with more DB features integrated. Fast forward to today, it is a full-fledged database platform with enterprise features that rival (and in some cases) even bests Oracle, MSSQL, DB2, et al. For customers who intend to use SAP for the foreseeable future, you would no doubt have HANA already as part of your existing if not future SAP roadmap, given that support for the traditional DBs is until 2025.

SAP HANA, which is re-written from the ground up to fully take advantage of today's modern hardware, supports multi-threaded CPU architecture, use of terabytes of memory to run its in-memory database capabilities, columnar & row based database with full-fledged compression, full support of PL-SQL and many other application components.

From a hardware perspective it is a 2-horse race with the commodity Intel x86 platforms becoming more powerful with each CPU iteration and better CPU core-to-memory ratio support, and IBM with their Power-based CPU architecture. As hardware prices continue to fall and become more powerful, it is only a matter of time before HANA hardware becomes truly commoditised.","Cons: Today SAP HANA is not only a competent database platform, but also is a very robust applications platform. As HANA continues to grow its feature set naturally there are more bugs as a result of a multitude of features. Development of SAP HANA is also diversified across multiple locations around the globe (Walldorf, India, etc.). SAP must do a better job in responding quicker to customers with issues.","Overall: Must-use for all SAP customers, given that it is critical to SAP's success as an enterprise software company.",
329,sap_event_ticketing,All in one & easy,Leah P.,DB Admin,"Management Consulting, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Software Advice,2017-11-07,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,10.0,"Comments: For an all in one suite ERP, this is the best. Although some areas are not quite as robust as some would like, SAP really nailed it with this one. They address a huge span of customers with the one product, which is completely customizable if you want to spend the money. However, most of the time, companies find that they can walk with the product, no customizations for the first 6mos. Then they get a good feel for what they want to change.","Pros: SAP took all of the knowledge gained with ECC, B1, etc. & published it into this cloud solution. You buy the license, and you have access to all modules. It is not a new charge to add in Project Management for example. You just turn it on. Online help documents are outstanding, and you can literally learn the entire software functionality by following them. With it being a cloud solution, you get auto updates every 3mo, which is nice. It updates some of the default government fees, for all of the countries you have in your system. Expense reporting for example. There is very little administration needed to let the software flow once you turn it on. And the best part is that you just need internet to access the software.","Cons: It is for mid-size businesses. So for larger organizations, the licensing can get pricey. There is a limited amount of knowledge in the field on the product, so it can take some time to get answers for some topics from the partners, or to find info online.",,

Most of my knowledge is self-taught from the online documents. This system is as robust as you wish it to be. The thinking has been done. Language packs, which apply in all modules, Country-specific financial rules that are updated constantly (IRS Guidelines for Expense Reporting for example), auto calculations, multi-currency use within one transaction. A counter part in Germany can operate in German, while all of mine can be in English when I am troubleshooting their issues, I think is outstanding. SAP is constantly updating, they have a great team backing the product, it is very personable user experience in my opinion. We use it for Order to Cash. We use the Supply Chain set up, full Financials. Production of Materials, Purchasing, Customer Service, just not POS. Although it has the ability, our business does not operate that way.","Pros: The process is built in, it is native to the operation of the system. SAP's been in the business long enough to be able to take all of the success from Enterprise ERP applications that they have built, and merge this into an online application. The product is very versatile for what I would think many styles of business. I personally enjoy the idea of not having to program the system to react a specific way, I work through the process in a test, using the online documentation, some time with an SAP Partner (Consulting Company), but the hours spent there are little. We also have the additional SDK, so we can write some personalization to the product if we wish to. The SAP Support tools are wonderful, there is probably too many resources to reach out to.",Cons: Not available in HTML in the production environments yet. Some users have been testing out the HTML in the test tenants. It is completely different layout. We would love to be able to drag & drop attachments instead of having to browse to them.,,"Recommendations to other buyers: I personally would recommend this product to anyone looking to upgrade or start out with an ERP / MRP. This tool is very robust, you can bring on one module at a time, and all different implementation partners know what they are doing, as SAP validates their abilities first. This is a very well-thought out product."

Best part of this software is it removes the burden of maintaining any additional system to hold our data it acts as 2 in 1 which holds and generates output results.so that we can run live and make better business decisions in the new digital economy.The features are like reduce its complexity, we can run this any where and can give accurate and real results some more additions operations it include are Transform data management,Process data in memory,Leverage advanced analytics, and can develop advances applications. Best storage as well as analytics based software that stores in Idoc data presentations",Cons: The SAP Hana was very least thing to say because it is very best in tool for holding large massive data and its generation of the reports but we requires additional changes in the page layout and design of the SAP lOGON need to be changed and immediate password change assitance need to be required. if they implement this software will be very more useful,,

Properties like faster data fetching, quick execution times, speedy access to external Apps make it a very useful technology. The business problems being solved with the product are as the data volume grows, the conventional database based reports and processes tend to slow down. This at times negatively affects the year on year trend analysis and processes requiring multiple data fetch. HANA, being in memory database virtually eliminates these issues. The data fetch is almost instantaneous and the processes run much faster.",Cons: I see nothing negative about the technology in itself. The roll out of this platform could have been done in a better way. The cloud integration of SAP has been slow as well. These I thing that can be looked into,"Overall: I what find is that since SAP is firmly sticking with in memory computing and making all of their processes compatible with in-memory computing. This eventually forces customers to migrate to HANA but the user experience in HANA is much better compared to the alternate in my opinion. This is recommended for any SAP customer with large volumes of data that needs processing, reporting and analysis. I would recommend with training",

The vision from management, especially our director, to move the organization processes to next level by digitalization of business processes.

The data processing speeds are greatly improved on the HANA platform. This is due to the in-memory technology incorporated into the system.

2. Very easy to set up and integration with SAP is almost flawless. This is especially true with cloud.

3. The user interface is not only eye catching, it also incorporates analytics which enable the users to create interactive dashboards, graphs and widgets.

4. Since it is a database in itself, which supports data to be stored in columns (as opposed to the previously used MS SQL, which stores in rows), it allows for faster data processing, analytics and more efficient storage of data.

5. It allows a company to monitor key KPIs.

6. In terms of security, it is very efficient. It relies on encryption, patching and best practices when it comes to security. It is also linux-based which provides a very secure platform","Cons: 1. The hardware and software specifications required to run HANA may be unavailable to some businesses hence if a company wants to use it, the would have to acquire them.

2. The dashboards and some of the analytical features are unavailable on mobile.

3. While customizing and writing stored procedures, one must be very careful as the application is linux-based hence it is case sensitive.","Overall: It is very reliable, fast and efficient. It has enabled many companies to streamline processes and access a myriad of information related to their companies in real time",

Before this concept of in-memory computing and memory storage (without reading the disk all the time), some reports took very long to load. Now you can get access to a larger piece of data in seconds. HANA also brings BW to another level of real time reporting, even detailed information can be shown in no time, its very fast. The way we build views by using the HANA Modeler is very simple but yet powerful, you can do a lot with little knowledge and much more with some expertise.","Cons: The tools used to work with HANA are both the HANA Studio or Eclipse with SAP HANA plugins. In my opinion, it could be better than it is; with more components, less bugs (you have to restart the environment every once in a while) and a better explanation about how the aggregation you see has been formed (Simpler than PlanViz).","Overall: With SAP HANA, my skills in view calculations have increased, I have another point of view about how to create one type of report or another. It is also very productive and very fast response. In addition with other tools like SAP Lumira, Qlik View / Sense and Tableau you can get a nice result, it leverages BI to another level and makes your experience even better.",

It has BI and CRM, that surpasses the traditional ERPs and with Hana accounts with very good operating performance.","Pros: SAP Business ByDesign is an ERP very easy to use, to implement and that allows to have 360å¼ information of the whole company in real time. It is very easy to learn to use by the end users. It has very good integrated BI reports. It's the beautiful SAP","Cons: SAP does not do much promotion to the product, to success stories and not much is known about its strengths in what the cloud managed by SAP itself.

This is a massive creation by SAP which makes all enterprise runs smoothly.

My experience with SAP ERP was very good. Below are some of them,

1. Navigating to different screens was easy

2. The shortcuts provided for each screen navigation as well as field/option navigation was very great

3. Various types of reporting facilities was again one another big feature of this.

4.

Reports such as: accounts payable open items, cash reconciliation, cash - open items, payment monitor, and supplier account information are easily generated and always accurate","Cons: -When entering invoices with many lines in SAP, calculated tax amounts for each line sometimes changes as I add more lines in the invoice. Software sometimes has trouble calculating correct tax and gross amounts for invoices when multiple lines, cost centres, GL accounts, tax codes are entered

-As I enter invoice items while entering an invoice in SAP in the view all screen, I'm unable to enter a credit memo line item.

Probably the best customer service i've ever dealt with ever. Louis was available via email and phone and wrote back to emails immediately. I never felt stressed waiting for a call back from him b/c he was so prompt in getting back to me. I really wish all companies had someone as attentive and reliable as he was with ticketpeak.

-The site is very easy to maneuver through. At first i wasn't sure what to click and where to go but after playing around a little bit, it was mostly self explanatory and most people would have no problem using it.

-EXTREMELY quick in getting our site up and running. It was less than 24 hours from the time i sent Louis our seating chart and we started selling tickets.

-LOVE that you can add a jpeg logo to personalize tickets.

-It's GREAT that you can add messages on the ticket regarding the show.

-the reports the site provides are SOOOO informative and helpful afterwards.

-We received a ton of compliments.",Cons: I can honestly say that i cannot think of any cons of this site or the people that i dealt with. It really is a fabulous site and program and I have and will continue to recommend it to people who could benefit from it.,"Overall: We had decided this year to switch to online assigned seat ticketing so that it would be less work for us during the school day and less lines at the door due to the fact we were always general admission. We went back and forth on whether or not we wanted to do it and i look back now and i'm mad at the time we wasted making a decision because it was THE BEST DECISION we could have made. It saved us SOOO much time and aggravation and kept our lobby so much more pleasant. In the past people waited an hour or more on line so that they got a good seat. Now, people came 15-30 minutes before show time, could walk around the lobby and then go in to their assigned seats. We noticed we also sold a lot of merchandise in our lobby this year because people did not need to stand in line, which was an extra added bonus! DO NOT WASTE TIME, EMAIL TICKETPEAK TODAY!!!

Good Support.

Front Side simplicity and intuitive user friendly GUI that even our Senior/Non-tech savvy customers can use easily.","Cons: Some changes are slow and others happen like lightening- it makes for a bumpy ride at times, and soft/whiney employees can have a hard time dealing with the changes or lack there of.

The system does not have a simplistic, intuitive, or as yet, reliable accounting system to integrate into our bookkeeping or payroll- though I am told this maybe coming.","Overall: been using this product for over 4 years now- and we have had in grow with our business. In the beginning we were using home made database that was very specifically engineered to our needs, but wasn't capable (because of its age) of taking online reservations. We integrated the basic online component of Betterez into our system with a high degree of extra effort on our customer support staff side. Eventually we changed our in-house system and policies and made the move over to a Full Time Betterez system; this change was a little rough in the beginning but we received great support from the Betterez team and it worked out well. Now almost 5 years later we are still reaping the benefits of an up to date, supported, and growing reservation system. It has been wonderful to be a part of the development of the Betterez system.","Recommendations to other buyers: This has been a successful, customer friendly and positive system for our needs. I had looked into using interline reservation system with Greyhound and or Amtrak, but this was a much better choice for someone being focused on positive customer service experience."

We had books to keep track of passengers and availability and paper everywhere. We tried to have custom reservation platform built and it was an expensive lesson that did not even get off the ground. I got introduced to Betterez and had several conversations with their reps. I could not believe how much time these guys dedicated to me and my little company. Still, to this day, they both take a personal interest in what is going on and how we are making out with the program. Anytime I have a thought or request for a change, they listen and ask questions. Betterez is very simple to use and get onto using. I love that it is cloud-based, I can log in anywhere in the world from my phone or tablet. We very recently launched our online purchasing through our website, this is helping us provide our customers with another easy and safe method to check the availability of seats and to buy tickets. This will help me achieve my goal of being paperless.",Recommendations to other buyers: I would absolutely recommend Betterez to anyone. It has made our life easier.

All new features and tech upgrades ensure our business to be ahead of any new requirements in our industry. Through promo codes I was able to launch regular marketing campaigns which drove ticket sales. I now offer bundled tickets which allows my passengers to benefit from discounts on a regular basis.

From the start they were highly responsive to our needs and requests, building out their product with constant enhancements. Those improvements have continued and they are always introducing fantastic new additions and capabilities despite already having been a highly effective solution. They have constantly improved in every aspect, from the product to their customer service, with an organized vision for future enhancements that seems to be largely based on the requests of their customers. Similar services have tried to convert us over the years to their product, but when stacked up next to Betterez, they've all fallen short.

Researched alternatives and Betterez won me over with their cost, ease of setup, and their customer support. It took a couple of days to setup our daily airport run, cross-state shuttle, and other seasonal trips.","Recommendations to other buyers: If you're looking for an easy to maintain reservation and ticketing system with superb customer service, Betterez is the way to go!"

The 5 day Operations page is so easy to read, I also like that the Orange bar does not move anymore.

- I love the ability to connect with other systems and the OTAs

- I appreciate the help from reps. They are efficient, professional and knowledgeable. If they're not sure about an answer, they check before stating it as true. Other support staff has not been as helpful.","Cons: - Reliability - It seems that with every fix that is released, one issue is solved but then another problem occurs or key functions are removed.

- Slow loading

- Need the ability to custom design the manifests

- Communication - I wish there was more communication as to when updates are released and what the update includes.

- It can be very time consuming to get stuff completed. I.e. removing bar codes from our system, updating the training website to match the live site, etc...

- The email/SMS notifications should be an easier process. Creating and editing them is difficult and time-consuming. They are a great feature but need to be more user-friendly.

- We have created so many workarounds for our charters department. It is not a usable system for our charters division without these workarounds.

- Not having the ability to edit some of the hard-coded wording on our website along with the receipt portion that guests receive when printing their tickets.

- Need the ability to archive old stuff like employees, agents, activities, etc...

- Need the ability to put date bands around everything. It's frustrating to have to link and unlink activities depending on availability.

- Reports not being the correct i.e. report by agent, summary by activity

- The reports available for accounting purposes are not detailed enough or contain so much additional, unneeded information that manipulating the report isn't any faster than the other system we have in place.",,

We were up and running with a few days and were quickly able to use the software to stream line our business. Zaui was able to quickly customize parts of their program to fit our business.Our business doubled in the first year of operation with Zaui and grew by 40% in the second year and we expect continued growth in future years. Zaui integrated into our website seamlessly to provide an easy shopping experience for our customers.,"Cons: Integration into our financial system has been a bit of a challenge, but now seems to work fine. More comparative reports from one year to the next would be helpful.","Overall: We did a deep dive on about four booking platforms before we made the decision to go with Zaui. As an operation we were ham strung with phone calls and had a great deal of difficulties keeping track of bookings and taking payments. During my search I found that most of the booking platform offered essential the same features. The difference was location and the level of personalized service.

The branding ability makes it seem like our customers are still on our website.,Cons: What I like least is it cannot be completely customized for my requirements.,Overall: Like any new software it takes time to learn it's full power but this is one of the easiest programs we have used.,
634,simpletix,"We're an annual community event that happens once-a-year, this is our first time using SimpleTix.",Buster A.,Producer sdleatherpride.org,,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,2018-01-07,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Everything I could imagine needing from this software is included in the basic features. The cost-per-ticket is less (less if you pre-print) AND SimpleTix helps us figure out the Square pass-through fees and include them in the service fee cost. Had no issues setting up Square. I like that anyone can use their phone to scan with the app. To be fair, at the time of this review I have used the website to setup a pretty decent ticket portal, but we haven't tested it at the door yet. We are excited that we can change the email form letters that people get when they order. I think getting actual labeled tickets makes the guests feel more confident as well.","Cons: I don't think it's a con, but in order to maximize the program/website, you may have to ask a few questions. There was no issue for me on that part, I received a more-than-thorough response any time I needed it. (I accessed help by phone and email, both were outstanding and easy.)","Overall: Organizing attendees for a five-day festival and contest, so we want to track who is interested in attending and be able to promote with discount codes and other perks. Also able to issue manual tickets, have them emailed, or sent as text to phone. Also lots of ways to set up your site with a theme, though I decided the standard look was the best for me. Honestly, I like having the ability to customize and this site allows so much customization. Also, they don't hold back all the features for the premium membership, they're generous with the features you get compared to other, more expensive sites even if you stick to the basic level. I would totally use the premium features, but we aren't at that budget level yet. However, under a less amount for each ticket is a great deal.",
635,simpletix,SimpleTix is simply a great ticketing and events platform,Adam W.,Project Manager,"Marketing and Advertising, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,2019-04-24,4,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,,"Pros: There were several aspects of the SimpleTix platform that were extremely beneficial. We vetted many options for ticketing platforms for our event, and SimpleTix was a clear front-runner from our first discussion. The pricing was very reasonable and competitive, and the functionality of the platform met our essential needs for the customization that was required for the specific event, which called for a custom floor plan and reservation system.","Cons: There were some seemingly very basic features that we were told couldn't be done. Needs and requests such as changing the color of a reserved seat to the color red or black upon reservation, or the specific numbering of seats in a certain configuration were not met, as we were told things like this couldn't be done. From the outside, functionality requests such as these seem very simplistic, so it was a shame these smaller things couldn't be accomplished.","Overall: Overall our experience with SimpleTix was tremendous! I cannot say enough good things about the communication, care, responsiveness, and helpfulness that our reps offered. All correspondence and requests were met in a very timely manner, the support for customization and edits was absolutely fantastic! Completely wonderful customer service!! 5 stars!",
636,simpletix,The Solution We Needed,Roger P.,General Manager,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2011-11-25,4,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,,"Pros: We started looking for an event ticketing solution and we reviewed many differerent providers. We chose SimpleTix based on the fact that it offered not only a ticketing solution, but also a shopping cart solution. The learning curve for SimpleTix is not too steep, the company offers dozens of self-help video tutorials that helped alot in the beginning. Since I am not a web developer, it probably took me longer to get the site up an running than would be a professional developer, but I am very happy that I took the time to learn the application. Now I can add and modify events with a few clicks, add new images, promotional banners, promo codes, products, and other pages to the site without going through a web developer. Now for the fun part, the ticketing side works great and everyday we get a bcc email from customers who have bought event tickets online. The system works and it's very cost effective for all the components your get. We are very happy we chose SimpleTix.","Cons: For what we use SimpleTix for, I really can't think of any con's.","Overall: We like working with SimpleTix because they are a young, growing company and we feel we can grow with them. The service is 5 star and if a problem does crop up, they are quick to remedy the situation. The site has so many features that we have not utilized all of them yet. It's by far the best bang for the buck on the market today, hands down.",
637,simpletix,3rd year of using SimpleTix for a fund-raising event and wouldn't think of going elsewhere.,Sally E.,CFO,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,2018-05-23,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,,"Pros: Software is easy to use and any questions/issues have been answered quickly/efficiently by the support staff. 1st year set-up required quite a bit of help to tailor our needs and help us understand how to make the most of the product. The support staff was great with this process. The 2nd and now 3rd year have been seamless.

We were able to add a feature this year to allow contributors to make donations in addition to purchasing tickets for the fund-raising event, which should greatly increase our total contributions.","Cons: 1st year took a little getting used to, but could be my lack of technical skills. Once things were explained by the support staff, found the software easy to use and navigate between the administrator/set-up functions and our website.",,
638,simpletix,Wonderful service - and it just works,Peter B.,Founder,"E-Learning, Self-employed",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,2019-04-28,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Used a bunch of other ticketing systems for my events. Simpletix is affordable, has all the features I need, and it *just* *works*. Really nice change from many of the others I've tried. Also, customer service is amazing - they really go the extra mile - being super responsive and supportive. I upgraded to a plan I didn't need by mistake and within 20 minutes of contacting support, the CEO reached out personally to help out and quickly resolved the issue.","Cons: Nothing. Had a really good experience using it. Perhaps not the ""prettiest"" UI on the admin side, but looks good for ticket buyers and works flawlessly on both sides.",,
639,simpletix,Great ticketing software with reserved seating features,Pratibha K.,Ticketing Coordinator,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,2017-07-07,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,,"Pros: The overdue review - Simpletix was able to solve my organization's need of providing reserved seating. With some learning, I was able to create a seating chart, assign differing prices to seats (even within different rows and seating blocks), and integrate the software to payment gateways seamlessly. The customer support I received was excellent, and really helped me (not knowing any css programming) customize the software per my requirement. The turnaround time for my queries was quite fast, with support available on weekends. Despite a couple of concerns as I have mentioned in the ""Cons"" section, I will definitely use Simpletix again for all of my ticketing needs in the future and recommend it to others.","Cons: One major concern I faced was that I had to redo the entire seating chart (with the complicated layout and the differing prices) 1 day before our launch due to some software issue. I did receive support for this, but I would have liked to avoid the last minute scramble. Also, updates to the code in the background caused a few minor changes, but I did get good customer support in addressing them.

Finally, I found that the help and user guides were somewhat confusing in the way they have been organized, and can be arranged in a more intuitive fashion.",,

SimpleTix was recommended to us, so got in touch with them and they walked us through the entire process from set-up to final close-out. We needed their help many times through the process - customer service was excellent and all of our needs/issues were taken care of in a timely manner. They also helped us with integration from the ticket sales to a merchant account so funds could go directly to our bank account. Very affordable - would highly recommend to anyone in need of ticket sales, donations, other sources of public funding.",

And much of it is automated - leaving time for us to focus on other things.,Cons: The only thing that would make our experience any better would be how our guests redeem gift cards. That we still need to do manually.,,
642,simpletix,I had missed a step in setting up payment. Received fast response to complete the process.,Tim J.,Executive Director,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,2017-12-05,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: As a small non-profit with only one major annual fundraiser, SimpleTix provides great pre/post reporting, it's easy to navigate, most importantly-easy for my guests to purchase tickets. I've only needed customer support one time. I reached out at end of business day and would have been pleased to have received a response the next morning. I leave the office, go to dinner, check my emails and had received a response by email with the solution less than an hour after submitting a ticket. I was able to correct the issue with my phone using the link provided and we were ready to sell tickets! Additionally, when I got to the office the next morning I had received a phone call from Aron on how to address the issue. Impressive!",,,
643,simpletix,Professional-looking reservation site with outstanding customer support,Nancy S.,President,"Public Relations and Communications, Self-employed",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,2017-12-04,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: As a small business owner, it was important to me to provide a reservation system that was businesslike and professional. I was able to get all of the features I needed at an affordable rate. SimpleTix was super-great about follow-up and support. I signed up for their personalized web support when I started, which I would recommend for anyone like me who isn't particularly tech-savvy. Aron was great about helping me answer subsequent questions that were specific to my site and not in FAQs. He even created a video tutorial in about 15 minutes based on one of my questions. So, good continuous improvement, too!","Cons: The only reason I didn't give five stars is that I actually did have to ask for help a couple of times. I found the payment gateway portion to be the biggest challenge -- not because of SimpleTix, but more on the payment processor side (choosing a provider that would fit my needs, getting the account up and running and getting the proper info to interface with SimpleTix).","Overall: This software allows us to easily get people registered for our workshops through an affordable, professional-looking site.",
644,simpletix,Used this to sell tickets online. Could it be easier? No!,CORINNE B.,Co-Chair,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-08-01,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: This was amazingly intuitive software that allowed me to customize how we sold tickets, what they looked like and how to keep track of sales. This was for a non-profit event and the price was incredibly reasonable. I was able to integrate other software, like Quicken and Square, in a snap! I really recommend this program and can't say enough about how responsive the developer was to helping when I needed to be pointed in the right direction.","Cons: The only thing I would have liked but could not do was delete purchases. I made several as I learned how to use the software and couldn't delete them from the event. But over all, it was not a big deal.",Overall: Quick and simple ticket sales.,
645,simpletix,Does not work for events that have multiple event times and locations,Karla B.,Executive Director,"Museums and Institutions, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,2019-01-18,2,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Many options

Option to scan pre-purchased tickets at the door","Cons: -It couldn't work for our festival, as we have multiple events at different times, like 3 bus trips and a banquet.

-2 different support staff told me it would work, and in the end, it did not","Overall: I was skeptical about it working for our festival, but the support team assured me it would and even set it up for us after I gave them all the necessary information. But when registrations started coming in and I couldn't get reports that I needed and event tickets listed one location and time for all events. Then team told me I had to set it up differently, so I spent 3 hrs doing it. During test runs after finishing I realized people could not purchase admission and a banquet ticket and a bus trip ticket without checking out 3 times...once for each ticket.",

Automatically emailing tickets to our attendees makes our event feel more professional. It also integrates with our DonorPerfect system which is helpful.,"Cons: We run events in three different countries, and we couldn't really manage all of our events from one account. I ended up having to setup a separate account for each country. That's not the end of the world, but it does make it more confusing for the users in our office.",Overall: I found out about SimpleTix through a DonorPerfect conference. This is a great service for us because our events are free to attend. SimpleTix offers their service for free to people who are offering free events so this has been a wonderful help to us.,"Recommendations to other buyers: If you host free events, this is definitely a great service. The prices for paid events seem reasonable as well."

We were able to customize our forms to look great and interface with Square for credit card sales. The software lets you make all the decisions and the support staff has been amazing when I got stuck. They respond super fast and are full of great ideas!",Cons: The learning curve for settings took longer than I expected. There are a few areas that seem to overlap and that required some duplication of work. There were things I just didn't realize from a surface look that were easy once support staff pointed me in the right direction. Perhaps an FAQ or settings overview document would help.,Overall: Don't know yet. Hoping being online will increase our attendance.,
649,simpletix,"Customer Service Response is usually fast, but this company has oversold its capability.

The customer service person is usually fast to respond. However, when we point out to him that his server is slow, and the system is slow, he seems to gloss over that problem.","Cons: We have many, many complaints about the speed of the site, customers getting locked out, seats that were abandoned in the shopping carts being held as ""unavailable"" to future patrons (which means lost revenue). The back-end interface is confusing, and could use a real examination and streamlining. You can't always get to what you need, and I never feel like I know the exact steps to find something.",,

It's slightlyl less intuitive than it's counterparts, but seemed a fair trade off at the time.","Cons: The UI is so buggy and slow, that it's really not worth it. It also is not as inexpensie as it purports, because connecting to Square actually adds the same cost per ticket as Eventbrite would have.... grrrrr. As I write this, I'm watching the wheel on my open tab for SimpleTix go round and round.... it's been doing this for 20 minutes with NO progress.... going back to Eventbrite.

If you get into a bind, their customer service and response time is out of this world! That means a lot to me as a client.","Cons: I haven't found anything that I don't like. I have a small business with some needs that may not be something that there is a function for, but something tells me that these guys will help me figure out how to make what I need happen.","Overall: When planning classes/events out of town, it's nice to know that the head count is set so I can order product and have it drop shipped based on the online registrations I've received with SimpleTix.",

The amount of time and energy I have to put into organizing events is significantly less because SimpleTix takes care of all the analytics and participant information automatically and keeps me updated anytime there is a sale. I haven't had many issues using it and most of the time it's easy enough to figure out quickly and without technical support; when I have needed technical support, though, it's pretty much immediate and accurate!

Set up of your own box office is relatively easy, but it easier still if you spend time writing all or marketing information and promotional pictures before you log in. Then have everything ready to copy and paste and upload the images. However, you can save your event pages as drafts to return to later, or update at any time.

You can set up different methods of payment to suit your requirements and can design the interface to match your brand.

Once set up your box office becomes fully automated, so you can check in to your dash board as frequently or infrequently as you wish and check sales and data as you wish.

They have an app you can download to your smartphone to be used for checking in, which saves on buying or hiring in barcode scanners and gives great data and feedback on attendance for future events.","Cons: As a small event's organiser, there is not a lot we dislike. The only modification I would like to see is to the monthly payment plan.

It jumps from one event payment plan to 5 events. Maybe they could introduce a 2 - 3 event plan?","Overall: Selling and monitoring of event ticket sales can be managed through your website and social media sites and becomes fully automated. It gives you an online booking office and enables the booking procedure UX to be easy to complete and payment can be secure through systems like PayPal. It automatically sends the customer the e-ticket and records their information for you to access at any time, along with sales data that can be invaluable for marketing and setting up other events.

You only pay per event or within a selected number of events depending on your payment plan. You pay monthly for the period of sales you want and can stop it at any time.",

Super quick set up time and very accessible to manage and make quick edits if needed,Cons: I dislike the fact that we cannot customize the look of our tickets and rather are stuck with the default 'QR' coded squares that are the printable 'tickets'. We would like to see something that allows us to be creative with the presentation of our tickets and make them feel like actual concert tickets,"Overall: Overall, very pleased with the software and no major qualms other than the ticket customization.

You can charge as much or as little as you want for tickets, and not worry that they are taking a cut of every ticket sold. Especially for expensive tickets, this amounts to hundreds of dollars in savings.","Cons: There are a few use cases that I've come across for which it isn't ideal, but I've contacted the developers and they are very helpful with taking suggestions and offering ideas. I will freely admit that some of my use cases are fairly esoteric, so if you're just doing a fairly normal event you should have no issues.","Overall: Overall we've used TicketTailor for almost 10 events over the past 2 years and love it.

I had a lot of questions as event ticketing was new to me and out of all the sites I emailed, Ticket Tailor provided the fastest and most comprehensive answers to all my queries. They made me feel very confident about setting up my box office and when the tickets went live they dealt with queries I had immediately (both queries turned out to be user errors!). This is such an easy website to use and very intuitive. The Ticket Tailor Help Centre is also very good and most answers you can find in their FAQs.",Cons: There is nothing I can fault about ticket tailor but I was unable to combine selling tickets for my event with the ticket purchasers ability to book preferred time slots which was important to the smooth running of my event.,"Overall: As a first-time charity event with a very small budget, the cost effectiveness of using Ticket Tailor as opposed to other sites meant that more of the money raised went to charity!",

This is where I found Ticket Taylor. On researching other companies of similar attributes, Ticket Taylor came out on top especially in the value for money department.

On signing up to the package, I soon found the site very easy to use. You can also SEO the ticket office to suit direct hits for potential online searches.

The system is, in my opinion, faultless. It made what a thought would be a cumbersome task into something very delightful.

The process of buying a ticket online was simple. I created links from the Facebook page and my website to the online ticket office.

I could regularly extrapolate information from the data collected by Ticket Taylor.

I found the e-ticketing system very useful indeed.

During the use of their system I had little need for help But when I did, their messaging system was simple to use and the small problems I had were dealt with quickly and in a very friendly manor.",,,,

Their platform is stable, easy to use and very customisable. They even offer a charity discount on top of their low pricing! We weren't sure about choosing someone other than the brand name for organising events online - let's call them Shiny Events - but TicketTailor have met all our expectations.","Cons: The only inconvenience we've found is that TicketTailor fees are paid to them via credit card, whereas card transaction fees are debited by their payment provider (Stripe) from the remittance. This has caused our accounts team a few challenges as the bank account we're having the remittance paid into isn't the same as the bank account with a credit card!

869,rezware xp7,Tour Reservation & Food Sales System,Kim G.,Interactive Manager,,,,Source: Capterra,2010-03-12,4,4.0,,5.0,,,,"Pros: Rezware is an affordable system that was able to be customized to meet our unique needs. When doing our research, it was the only system that allowed for this customization while having a base to start from that understands our business type. The system we were looking for had to accomodate reservations for two types of daily tours running on an hourly basis. We were also able to incorporate our food and drink sales into the system which was a requirement. The reporting gives us various ways to look at our data which we found has been a real need. And, while the system took a while for everyone to get comfortable with, we now find that it is quite easy to use. There are lots of shortcuts and helpful tools within it as well. And, having the training mode that uses real data is another very useful tool. Finally, the people at Rezware have been very responsive to our questions and providing support whenever needed.","Cons: Due to the customization of our system, the implementation took longer than anticipated. And, we have run into some glitches that probably wouldn't have happened if we used the system as is. But, the technology and customer support team at Rezware went above and beyond to remedy any situations that occured. There is not enough written documentation on the system so we had to develop our own reference manual. Our training sessions and calls with Rezware have always been helpful and has allowed us to map out how to use the system for our needs.","Overall: Rezware is a solid system that we expect to be using for a long time. And, we look forward to growing into the system more by using the additional features that are available. The customization has been essential to the requirements of our business. And, the support on the system has been very responsive and understanding of our needs.",
870,rezware xp7,RezWare is a good basic Tour Package Management System,Wendi K.,CEO,,,,Source: Capterra,2010-04-11,4,4.0,,5.0,,,,"Pros: The base package is easy to understand, allows for quite a bit of self-managed customization and the RezWare staff has been very helpful in training us how to get the most out of the system. The RezWeb Online module was easy to implement and the RezWeb programmers did a good job integrating with our web site graphics.",Cons: Our biggest challenge has been our own learning curve in understanding the impact of some of the custom programming changes we have requested of RezWare. We would have been better off to learn the system first and then decide what we wanted changed.,"Overall: My recommendation is that you first map your current requirements against the RezWare system. You need to understand what drives the data for your management reports and how the data flows through the system. Once you fully understand the core competency of Rezware, identify any potential custom modification requirements. Be sure and allocate enough time for testing before you need to go live with any changes.",
871,rezware xp7,Quite Flexible,Rachel G.,Office Manager,,,,Source: Capterra,2010-02-23,4,5.0,,5.0,,,,"Pros: The system accurately displays reports, is quick to navigate and once you've been at it a while it really becomes second nature. The support staff is quick to respond to queries and explaining the ""brain"" behind the system so you know why things work as they do.",Cons: Some small system hangups with printing at times. Sometimes it takes a little longer than desired to get changes made but then again our system is pretty specialized considering its initial design.,"Overall: The system is good and it works. We have a very specialized version as we use it for racing reservations and keeping count of gift certificates, strange discounts, laps, guests and programs and they've been able to make it work well for us.",

876,herogami,"Excellent value for money, capable platform for Agile projects with remote/global teams",Simona G.,Delivery Director,"Information Technology and Services, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,,Source: Capterra,2017-04-26,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Quick setup, ease of use, features-rich. The UI scales from a tablet-size screen up to large 30-inch monitors. The software is very fast and data entry for stories and issues is very well designed: data entry in Herogami is effective and quick and this is especially true when entering issues, which is a pain in other competing products. The visual Kanban boards are very clear and cards are well organized, there's multiple views to choose from, including swimlanes based on a large number of attributes. Effort planning and tracking is available as well as ""active notes"" that send comments via emails. Herogami notifies relevant events via email: assign / reassign, closing, notes and comment being entered, etc. Every action is recorded and listed in the project / sprint timeline with links to the entities being modified, this is actually very impressive. The UI is very, very clean and elegant and this contributes to the overall ease of use: our development team was quick to get up to speed with the platform that, literally, felt into our process like none we tested before. This has happened most likely by virtue of its conceptual underlyling clarity and sharpness.",Cons: The product is very flexible. In order to fully leverage all the features you want to spend some time with it. Yet the admin / setup UI is very clear (it's not Jira!) and taking it for a spin is a breeze. Document upload features may benefit from some drag'n'drop hot spots.,"Overall: Our team is sparse and remotely located, with developers living far away from each other. Running a software development consulting firm with a remote teams requires a project tracking tool that is available 24 by 7 and does not get in the way. We found that Herogami provides the right balance in terms of features completeness, ergonomics and cost. The platform is available in the cloud at a very convenient rate and and team setup is a breeze. Projects can be created in a matter of seconds and staff allocated. Agile practices are fully supported (sprints, stories, issues, backlog) and the shared wiki plays a roles in tracking project specs as well as review meetings. Document management and the shared project calendars are also a plus. Overall the platform does a lot for what it costs. Interfacing customer support was a breeze and they responded in a matter of hours. Overall the product is solid and is considerable easier to use than other comparable platforms in the Agile market.","Recommendations to other buyers: The company offers the option of hosting it on your own server, I have not explored this path but it's worth checking."

Once you get to know a couple menus everything falls into place naturally.,"Cons: Very few. A native mobile app would be great, yet the web version works great on both iPad and iPhone with a little attention. Kanban is not a tool for small screens anyway. I contacted support and got told that a mobile app for iOS and Android is on its way.","Overall: We manage a portfolio of complex projects with sparse and remote teams. Herogami does an excellent job keeping everyone in the loop. A good balance in terms of features and ease of use, not too simple that it feels like a toy, not too complex to get in the way or require external consultants.

In any view you have a vast list of options to filter your data and nobody in my team has never had a problem to retrieve any information.

The sprints dashboard is so tidy and essential that you could share it to any external stakeholder without the fear to be incomprehensible.

Data entry forms are very effective: you can easily manage the rapid flow of ideas tipical of a brainstorming without losing a bit.","Cons: After few months of use, I miss the possibility to create a new task directly from the kanban lane and save and share customized views.

I'd like to have a Zapier integration also.","Overall: Herogami has the rare ability to make you feeling confortable after a brief session of work: no matter how complex the project to manage, its smart data-entry form, its many effective builtin' views puts YOU at the helm of the ship.

Value for the product is great! If we need any assistance or something quits working, they're staff will jump on a call right away. Our rep is always great at getting back to us in a timely manner and solving any and all problems. The group portal upgrades were much needed and I think they nailed it. Much easier to use and much quicker to set up/maintain. I also like that CRM is build right in, so no need to purchase through another company.","Cons: Reports and running lists are not the easiest. Took me a while to figure out how to pull info I need. Also, from time to time, if I select what I need (seeing holds for an event/solds/ect.) still no information shows. Seems like there's a list for everything you would want/need, just figuring out the best and most convenient ones is key. The last thing would be any individual seats in a customers cart that are trying to get deleted. Other systems all you need to do is click on the seat to select, and click again to delete from your cart. With Glitnir you need to click on the seat to select, and on the right hand side, check the box on the seat you do not want, then select delete. Seems like this is something they could upgrade.",Overall: Overall it's been a great experience. The Glitnir team is always looking for ways to improve and evolve. Customer service has been exceptional from all team members. We've also seen our online ticket sales grow from year to year using Glitnir.,

The dedication of the Glitnir to solve challenges in the ever changing UK ticketing arena has been second to none. The market differs significantly from the US model with events where demand regularly outstrips capacity - the team developed an easy solution to control who can buy and when without any compromise to response times online and the robust financials that underpin the service. The innovative integration with Google to deliver the online customer ability to walk around the venue, see 360 view and then choose seat is exceptional.",Cons: The robust engine that underpins the service needs a comprehensive administration back to end that enables user management but at first is a little daunting. The team have done some major improvements and continues to provide a better interface. As this only affects a couple of people in th organisation this is only a minor irritant.,"Overall: Our experience over the past 5 years has seen the system deliver increased sales, massive improvements in customer service, cost reductions and flexibility to enable the company to grow quicker than expected. The user online service, event scanning and adaptability have made a significant contribution to the clubs migration from an old style sports club into a dynamic 21st century business encompassing and embracing the modern online and mobile services.",

There are generally multiple ways to access the info you're looking for. Step by step is as simplified as it can get and selling tickets to games is full proof.,Cons: It isn't too user friendly. I'm used to it but new users say it is complicated to learn and the overall theme the online purchaser reports is that it is tough to work through. Figuring out how to generate certain reports can be complicated or tricky because there is so much functionality that it becomes confusing.,"Overall: I've always been a fan of Glitnir Ticketing. I've worked with their ownership since my first day on the job and they are a very hands on company and will quickly assist you with any problems. I can't stress that enough, you can email or call and they will promptly work directly with you to figure out the problem or guide you through the steps.

We've been using them for some time now and once everything was up to speed, the buying process was simple! The features they offer are exactly what we were looking for from the buying process, to the CRM, to the Group Portal and newsletter features. The customer service is great! They usually stay on top of all the details.","Cons: The most difficult task is trying to find the report that you are looking for to pull the most accurate information. They offer a wide variety of reports, so there may be one that works just right for you! There are some bugs with the software (not bad) that take time getting use to.","Overall: Switching to a new ticket system is like learning how to walk again.

896,glitnir ticketing system,Relentlessly Helpful Customer Support Unlocks Glitnir's Full Potential,Karl M.,Director of Ticket Operations,,,,Source: Capterra,2010-08-12,4,5.0,,5.0,,,,"Pros: One of the most impressive things about the Suns' partnership with Glitnir has been our success advertising and selling more than just cut-and-dry individual-game tickets through the online system. I've been amazed at the number of new customers we've brought in who have been able to take advantage of some of our unique ticket promotions without having ever spoken to a member of our ticket sales team. Glitnir's Promo Code setup is so user-friendly that we have literally been selling our popular Chipotle Friends & Family packages in our sleep, racking up sales of our most popular ticket package long after the box office closes. We've sold out all four of our Friends & Family games so far this season, largely because Glitnir's Promo Codes make purchasing the plan online so quick and convenient.","Cons: When I first started using Glitnir, I would keep a running list of what I thought were problems with the system -- things that seemed flawed or that just didn't seem to work with what we do here in Hagerstown. As I worked more and more with my Glitnir representatives, though, and they took the time to walk me through each and every ""problem"" I brought up, the list dwindled. At this point, there really are no problems with the system as far as I am concerned. It took me some time and hard work to get comfortable with the Glitnir system, but all the effort was rewarded because at this point I feel like Hagerstown has a ticketing system that suits us perfectly.",Overall: I would recommend Glitnir to any user that wants to get more than just the bare bones out of their ticketing system -- anyone who is willing to put in some work so that they can feel totally comfortable with their system and capable of using it to enhance all elements of ticket operations.,

Gordan, DJ and Ian all put in extra hours to make certain that we were up and ready to roll after having imstalled the system 5 weeks prior to our opening day. They have fielded phone calls on weekends, checked out problems for us after hours and made certain everything was in proper working order before signing off on the job.",Cons: Online ticket customers can leave single seats from a transaction. This has been my biggest fault with the system. Our stadium is not that large and on busy nights we will use every reserved seat that we have so eliminating singles is huge for us.,"Overall: The Glitnir Ticketing System is a solid tool. For mid to low budget teams looking to have their customer database coupled with their ticket system, I feel it is one of the strongest on the market, presenting great value in addition to it's ease of use.",

Any time I had an idea that would help grow sales they worked to implement. They have helped me with creating custom reports. It is an easy ticket solution for our customers which leaves them happy and they don't feel like they got hit with a lot of unnecessary fees that you may see with a larger ticketing solution.,

The customer service and helpful attitude they provided was and is fantastic. They worked with us through the entire set up process and really set us up for success and continue to respond immediately even when we have the smallest questions or issues.,"Cons: I still find the navigation and orientation to the system a little difficult. It may be because no one here has ever used a system like this. However I find it difficult to teach my workers (mostly students) and administrators how to use the system and for game day sales and even more difficult to show them how to access other features.

That being said, the Glitnir team did a great job showing me how to use it and my translation to others may need improvement.","Overall: There is a legitimacy in our department and in our ticketing that wasn't there before. Online and walk up sales are easier to manage and quicker to execute, and reporting sales and attendance is easier and more consistent.",

984,ticketsage custom solutions,We Love TICKETsage,Trish H.,Box Office Manager,,,,Source: Capterra,2009-09-30,4,4.0,,5.0,,,,"Pros: The absolute best thing about TICKETsage is their customer service. When the system was first implemented last summer, with our season tickets being printed and mailed from our office for the first time, we needed to depend on the staff of TICKETsage heavily. We came into the office on the weekend to print the tickets and were on the phone with TICKETsage support multiple times during the day. Since then, anytime we have the slightest problem, we are very comfortable calling (in an emergency) or emailing (if the situation is not dire) TICKETsage support. They are very prompt in returning our calls or email.

The day to day operation of the system is easy to use and dependable and it is pretty much impossible to ""mess up"" an application as the system almost always has you confirm or apply an application after it has been changed. The staff at TICKETsage is friendly and helpful even for us ""non-techy"" computer users.","Cons: The TICKETsage system has a lot of features that we do not use to the full potential. They seem complicated and confusing, although after a year of day to day use, I am becoming more comfortable with trying to solve problems before I call for support. Occasionally (maybe 3 or 4 times in the past year) there has been an error that needed to be fixed at the TICEKTsage end of the system. Only once in the past year did the system ""go down"" and was off-line for 15 or 20 minutes.","Overall: Overall, we LOVE TICKETsage! The few problems we have had are completely over shadowed by the great things about TICKETsage. I am sure that if we had the time to schedule a session with TICKETsage, they would be more than happy to help us learn how to use the features that we do not fully use and the reports (and there are many) from which we, thus far, have not been able to gather information. I'm sure it's all there, we just need to learn how to use it.",
985,ticketsage custom solutions,TICKETsage has gotten it right!,Willis A.,Executive Director,,,,Source: Capterra,2009-08-07,4,4.0,,5.0,,,,"Pros: Ease of use, flexibility, addons, customer service. This system is going to save us a lot of money through ease of use and reduced labor costs. If you have a subscriber base, data rollover, speed of processing, and package sales capability are very strong and useful features.",Cons: What few problems we had because of our special needs were taken care of in a prompt and courteous manner. Training could be improved with a manual and more personalized training to eliminate user error. In a few cases we found ourselves not understanding parts of the software. TICKETsage has been proactive in solving problems and helping us.,"Overall: After years of Ticketmaster, Tickets.com, New Era, and Showare, it is refreshing to find a ticket software that completely fits our needs. Their CEO was a breeze to work with and we settled into our deal with few complications and very little legal oversight. Our legal counsel pretty much said that everything was great with their contract and we should sign, this was a first for us. Their entire staff is to be applauded for their customer service and genuine attitude.",
986,ticketsage custom solutions,TICKETsage Untiy platform review,Jack N.,Operations Supervisor,,,,Source: Capterra,2009-08-07,4,5.0,,5.0,,,,"Pros: Untiy has an intuitive UI, easy to use for box office staff and patrons alike. It's exceptionally reliable for a hosted platform. I can't say enough about the tech support. They're always helpful; quick to respond and to add or modify features, if that's appropriate. Back-end reporting functions make it easy to generate basic reports or to export data from more complex analysis or marketing purposes. The system maintains reliable, accurate inventories for online and box office sales. Credit card processing is extremely fast, and they made it easy for us to settle directly to our bank. They have managed to balance ease of use with flexibility, making this a good product for almost any venue.","Cons: Some parts of the back-end are a bit rusty, although these are mostly cosmetic issues. Currently, online buyers can't use existing patron records resulting in duplicate patron info for orders placed online. I'd like for patrons to have to ability to use an email/password combo to order tickets. There's a tool to merge orders under these duplicate records, but that's a step I'd rather avoid...","Overall: In my opinion, of the systems I've looked at, Ticketsage offers services, features and really great technical support at a price point that can't be beat. We ticket about 30 events per year - 12,000 to 15,000 tickets per year - and Ticketsage performs pretty close to flawlessly.",

The ease of training new staff on this system makes it so valuable for our organization. Additionally, Curious Theatre Company has recently gone through significant changes in seating, all of which Ticketsage has accomodated with flexibility.","Cons: We've found that Ticketsage is not particularly compatible with Mac systems, which poses a problem for our organization.","Overall: Ticketsage is the strongest of the midsize ticketing systems that I have experienced, particularly because of their very responsive technical team.",

Steven and Sandy have been the best at understanding our business and working with us to achieve our goals.","Cons: Could use more people in Tech Support however Justine, Josh and Jessica are amazing.","Overall: The more you know about your specific needs the better Ticketsage is able to help you.

Picatic provides flexible and easy-to-use tools to handle registrations, check-ins, payments, and communication for your event. The crux of the system is in the ability to quickly create an attractive and responsive basic event registration in very little time. The ability to collect robust, custom information from clients is very helpful. Recently-added capacities to work in teams/groups and to manage events with multiple dates are very welcome. Support staff are quick and helpful.","Cons: Some of what makes the software the simplest/friendliest also causes some restrictions - i.e. the survey tool is limited in its configuration options meaning you cannot structure/validate the data, or the multiple parties cannot register together (parent with child, spouse with spouse).","Overall: This software provides a single tool for our department of four to create, administer, and market events to our clients and prospective market.",

Being completely new to the event space, we didn't realize how useful the management tools would be. The attendee lists, analytics, and email tools were crucial. In addition, Picatic's interface is really user-friendly. Our team had varying degrees of computer skill, and no one had a problem navigating the management tools. We required support to issue a complicated refund, their support team was prompt and friendly when dealing with our team and customer. Overall we've had a great experience with Picatic's product and team.","Pros: As mentioned, the management tools were a huge asset to our event. Now that we've used them we'd have a hard time living without downloadable entrance lists, attendee surveys, Google analytics, and Mailchimp integration. Picatic's interface is also really nice, it was user-friendly and intuitive.",Cons: There are a few features missing. (I understand that start-ups need to start somewhere and build up) We would love the ability to add time zones and close an even early. We would love to take advantage of their API for future events - a more seamless check-out that looks like part of our website will be really beneficial.,,

We can gather all the information we need through the surveys and the Picatic collects everything into useful reports that we can download and save. This cuts down on the need to go back and forth by email with registrants.,"Cons: In the past we have had some trouble with cutoff times between early-bird and regular ticket sales, but the Picatic team was very responsive and have made changes to address this.

The main appeal for me is its user friendly interface and customizable nature. For both events, I have been able to set up very aesthetically pleasing pages with custom graphics, posters and videos. I also very much appreciate that all customer information is collected and a guest list is complied for you.",Pros: -There is always support available if you run into troubles. I personally have rarely needed to use the customer support because the set up process is very easy to follow. - Donation feature and customer survey features are great additions to the regular ticketing app. - Visual customization easily done.,"Cons: - When loading a video onto your page, I noticed that it can only appear at the top of the page.

It is great it has different features available. A big pro is that Picatic is always innovating new features for a better customer experience.,Cons: The price has increased significantly over the past few years. This has been a challenge for our nonprofit organization that does not make as much money as a hospital foundation or foodbank so it is posing a challenge that could eventually direct us elsewhere.,"Overall: The features are ample for a good ticketing site, and the customer service is really good.",
998,picatic,Great Canadian Product for Events,Jane Ellen F.,Owner,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2015-06-29,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,8.0,"Comments: It is awesome that a Canadian company has come up with a way to give events a free service. Setting up tickets & the ticket website was very easy. One does not need to know any coding language making this a very appealing system to volunteer/charitable groups. If you are in need of a simple system, this is an event ticket system for you. I would highly recommend it to volunteer/charitable groups running an event that need a simple registration system with a ticket output. I personally look forward to the system evolving. Currently the additional fields answers download in a separate report known as ""Guest Surveys"", thus having to merge the entrance list and guest survey list together for a complete report - if you are not good at excel, this would be a hindrance. As well, you can't run multiple events, with different bank accounts, under one Picatic account. As an event planner who has multiple clients, with multiple events, this means running multiple accounts and is inconvenient. All in all, it is a great system that just needs some time to evolve. I love getting my weekly sales reports in my inbox - I don't have to go into the system to see how the tickets are selling. Thank you Picatic - I can't wait to see what you do next!",,,,

Can pay for multiple ""tickets"" at one time. For the most part was user-friendly for the attendees when registering, although a few did have difficulties with payment.","Cons: Not as user-friendly as I hoped.

I'd also like to be able to view full lists, which promo code was applied, and reorder the lists online rather than having to download each time.",,

This system makes that really easy to do.,"Cons: Could be some better exporting of sales for accounting. The door reports are great, but I'd like to export out a summary of sales for reporting to stakeholders and export transactions to an accounting system.",Overall: I've sold a lot of tickets to events through this system. It is my go-to ticketing system these days.,

I like that it easily integrates with our website. I've had helpful customer service.","Cons: I don't like that it makes me create the same survey every time I make a new ticket. I don't like that to pay with an invoice customers have to click ""OFFLINE"", which is very confusing and often unclear that this option will allow them to do an invoice. I don't like that I can't customize the email or the invoice that goes out to customers after they've bought a ticket. I don't like how much time I've spent manually putting in customer information because so many of them have had trouble using this product. :(",Overall: Using this product helped me learn what features I truly need and am looking for in a ticketing service so that I could make an informed decision on the next company we choose.,

Being able to link between our site and the event page was also very useful.,"Cons: We had a few issues with attendees unable to process payment for tickets, that may have been on the bank's side but still made selling tickets a bit more complicated.

Visually attractive and delegates found it easy to navigate to make bookings,"Cons: No option to provide partial refunds through Picatic in the case of a cancellation fee being deducted.

I just started using the Pro features and so far I like them.

The one thing I discussed with Robbie was the issue of offering Early Purchase discounts and his suggestion was to create multiple pages so that when the deadline for one was over the new one would be in effect. Other than that I really have not had problems with your products.

I have noticed that you now have a setup to offer clients your own processing of credit cards. One of the reasons I choose Strip was the instant payments into my account. My small business does not have sufficient cash flow to pay vendors upfront, if I have to wait for the money until after the event is over. I feel this may be an issue with small companies like my self.

I teach continuing education classes and adding classes to your list of options for what the event is doing would be a nice little addition.",,,,

1025,picatic,Very good,Karen F.,Minister,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2016-02-02,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,9.0,"Comments: Great product.

For the most part, easy to learn and use.

Customer service is excellent.

A couple of pointers would have made for a better experience first time through:

- before I can click on ""live"" let me know what i *can't* change once its live i.e. web address

- more clarity about pricing ... i felt that i had to do some searching to figure out what my ticket price would be, and whether I needed pro or not, and what I would need to purchase (in addition to picatic) to be able to charge for events.

One very minor bugs:

- in the event information panel, when I click on country, and then move my cursor to the next line, the country changes. This has happened with each of the four events I've made. I've discovered the workaround is to fill in the city first, then the country then the province i.e. not the order you've got them on the page.

Working with Picatic allows us to focus on actually hosting concerts rather than having to deal with all of the minutia related to ticket sales.

It was the first time we had used an online ticketing system for these events (normally the several hundred tickets would only be sold in the playground) and we saw an increase in the take up of tickets almost immediately. This I think was partly due to being able to send around general links and share the event on facebook (reaching a bigger audience) and also the ability for people to pay online securely. We will now use BookitBee for all PTA events and as a result for many other community events and would highly recommend it.,"Pros: Easy to use, flexible, low cost",Cons: None,"Overall: I have used Bookitbee for about a year now and they have been brilliant.

It's not only prompt but extremely courteous, no matter who we get. We also have had personal visits to check in and make us aware of new opportunities and programs. We just recently added brand new/upgraded scanners, combined with launching them on a rental client. Seat Advisor partnered with us the entire journey. We had over 3000 people come through that weekend and we looked efficient and professional.

1127,seatadvisor,Great Ticketing solution!,Kyle M.,Treasurer,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,2015-10-12,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"Comments: The Dallas Bach Society has gone through a number of different ticketing solutions, and to be honest, almost all of them left a great deal to be desired! In 2012, we began a search for a new ticketing solution and came upon SABO. We were impressed then with the flexibility, reporting features, Patron management and integrated marketing. When the problems with Java occurred we were very concerned because our online ticket sales dropped to about 25%, which meant that our phones were ringing off the hook because people could not purchase online. As you all know that was a very trying time. With the new enhancements and re-designs now our online sales is at about 90%!

The thinks we are most impressed with are the Patron Management features of automatically assigning attributes based on certain criteria. This is vital as we are a membership organization and we have to keep track of patrons who make donations of $50 or more. SAGO does this seamlessly! The second thing we are thrilled with is the Online Sales flow. Our patrons are very happy with the look, feel and ease of use of online purchasing. This alone has saved the organization a great deal of money! We constantly use the reporting features to keep track of Sales trends and sales volume. We also are impressed with the new MPP feature and plan to utilize it for special pricing events!",,,,

After searching for a ticketing solution for months, SABO stood out amongst the rest because of its informative sales/support team and pricing. Marc in particular (our client relations contact) has gone above and beyond our expectations from day one. Whether supporting a new business with growing needs and constant changes, providing specific and specialty support options, or creating solutions for problems we thought were too great to overcome - Marc constantly surprises us with his ingenuity and ability to meet our needs. Most recently, SABO added Social Network features that once again keep this system current with the growing demands and trend changes of the ticketing industry.","Cons: I must say that SABO has a range of reporting features that really help us understand who our customer base is, where they are purchasing from, how they heard about our event, and if they desire to be on our marketing contact list. However, as a client that is always looking for more data, I could use a couple more report options that allow me to understand our customer base with a little more ease of use and streamlined information.",Overall: If the pricing doesn't convince you that SABO is in it for the long haul and partnership relationship - then the customer support provided should hit the message home - SABO has genuine concern for its clients and ensures their success with personal attention and response to the needs of its users.,

User friendly

Social Networking features

Patron ease

Real time seating charts","Cons: Reports should be more customizable

Would like a review of a patrons history including seats, without having to select each order.

Price structure is very challenging to master and can't be changed.

Don't like how it inputs text for the event description.

Print at home tickets are great, however a challenge that we have when at the venue box office,patron needs us to reprint that ticket that has already been printed at home. There is no easy way to do that. I can't even begin to describe the process in which to accomplish it and most of the time we reprint the ticket by happenstance, not sure how we reprinted it. It's about a 4-5 step process unless there is an easier way that we don't know about.

Would still love to see a feature of refunding a ticket price to a donation. As a nonprofit we don't allow refunds on tickets, we do offer our patrons a tax letter on tickets donated back to us. Would love to release that ticket back into inventory and still capture the purchase.",Overall: Overall SABO is fairly easy to use and meets most of our needs. Even thought there are a few drawbacks that could easily be fixed I would defiantly recommend this product to any arts organization looking for a better ticketing option. It has continued to bring a professional image of our organization to our patrons. Huge thanks to Justin Baxter for his continued support.,

1131,seatadvisor,SeatAdvisor makes online ticketing easy,John G.,Trustee & IT Strategist,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,2015-08-19,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"Comments: Since we first implemented SABO in 2007, our organization has come a long way utilizing technology with our ticketing and online sales. The implementation process was very straightforward, with the largest obstacle being our internal volunteers adapting to the change from paper tickets. The training was done remotely though online collaboration and desktop sharing tools, which still continue today for any support needs which may arise.

The SABO interface and seat maps are very clean and professional looking. While we are a small non-profit community theater with 360 seats, we only use a small portion of the functionality. For example, we don't have a need for setting up portals and barcode scanning of tickets at the door as larger venues would use.

Setting up new events for our six show season, including the creation of three subscription plans is relatively easy. Fortunately, we set up our season once per year, but adding special events or additional performances on the fly takes no time at all.

One area we need to take a look at is the email integration with Vertical Response in hopes of sending out automated pre and post performance emails to ticket holders with relevant information including location, parking, and local dinner show specials with area restaurants.

While the per ticket and credit card gateway authorization charges can get high for a small non-profit such as ours, we still feel that SeatAdvisors offers a superior product compared to the competition.",,,,

SABO makes it easy to solve your own issues!","Cons: The reports sometimes have bugs, and I wish they were a little easier to manipulate. Even in excel, I'm doing more cutting and copying than just calculating. I'm dying for a Transactions by Patron report, where I can search an individual or range of patron id's and get a list of transactions.","Overall: I definitely recommend this software for a university performing arts center such as ourselves. Specifically for those who are just starting out and might be making the jump from hard tickets to software...learning the logic of event set up is quite easy on this software. I'm not so sure how well it would work for a bigger venue (we have 5 venues, the largest is only 500 seats), but if you're just getting going...absolutely a good web-based program! And a fantastic price, I should mention.",

With this company, I have been able to serve over 15 clients with unique needs, including subscriptions that involve events at multiple venues, reserved/GA seating at one event, GA events with different price scales, the list goes on. With SeatAdvisor, I am able to track my marketing efforts through the use of promo codes, and advertise upcoming events right on the Print at Home Ticket. The pick your own seat option is very useful! Since we have that option available to our online patron, we have successfully taken our walk up down to virtually nothing. We have now trained our audience to purchase their tickets online and over the phone reducing our staffing costs significantly! The support team is incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about the product.",Cons: SeatAdvisor does not offer a scan out option as part of their access control.,"Overall: I would recommend SeatAdvisor as a perfect ticketing solution for any venue, or group of venues. We are very happy with it at Southern Illinois University!",

I hope you realize how great you are and what a benefit I find in your assistance in any thing I need. You get back to me so quickly either by email if possible or by phone if needed, I don't feel like we are 2 time zones apart. We have so enjoyed the change to SABO and our patrons seem to like the ease of purchasing tickets and things we able to do send out email reminders of a show time, email a confirmation of an order and just being more user friendly.

We used to do everything by hand. Having SABO saved so much time that I have been able to enjoy my summer. It's like having an extra ""INTELLEGENT"" employee. The ease of the system is great for my customers. They love to have the opportunity to choose their own seats and print their tickets to bypass our long lines. SABO's customer service is amazing, I put in a ticket and I have answers within 30 minutes or a phone call to solve the problem. The customer service department is better than I would have ever imagined.","Cons: The only two things I wish SABO would do is: When a customer pays cash you can enter the cash so it tells you how much change to return to the customer. That would help our staff tremendously. Also, I wish SABO would be able to post the events right to ""Celebrity Access"", Facebook and Myspace. Other than those two small inconveniences SABO ROCKS!",Overall: I highly recommend SABO for anyone that is thinking about becoming automated.,

Our previous ticket service did not allow us to set fees - or retain convenience fees.

The system is stable and I have high degree of confidence that it will be so during our peak sales times.

Back office sales are effortless, the interface is easy to use.

Customer history feature is very useful.

Reporting is powerful. I appreciate the export feature allowing me to customize reports as necessary.",Cons: I really do not have any strong negative impression of either the product or the company.,"Overall: I am glad I made the change from the earlier program we used.

Probably the biggest driver for us to move to SABO was the ability to have an online box office. The online feature works fantastic, and has significantly reduced the wait times on the phone. Enabling Print at Home is a great feature and has dramatically reduced lines in will call. Other improvements are the map display, the stability of credit card reconcilliation, their willingness to adapt SABO and make changes to fit our needs, the ease of balancing etc. The staff at Seat Advisor is very open to any of our needs, and when feasible works to make any changes or enhancements we need.","Cons: There are rare occassions that because SABO is web based, we lose connectivity or are affected by other SABO patrons. It would be nice to be able to customize reports. Would be nice to have a patron summary rather than having to drill into each patron order.",Overall: Very highly recommended.,

We do a mixed bag of general admission and reserved seating that require tickets which are free or paid. SABO gives us the opportunity to create these events and make them available to our patrons online 24/7. ""Batch Print"" is a wonderful feature to have when creating the will call. It prints all the tickets in alphabetical order according to disposition. Another feature that is helpful to our business is the reporting feature. I find the ""patron profile"" report particularly useful information from each performance. The reports can be used on both paid and free concerts, and there are a dozen of different reports to choose from or even customize, if needed.",,,,

I love that we can make notes about each order------we use this function 80% of time----SO helpful. The maps are great.,"Cons: Price structures are VERY tricky. I also dislike the terminology for prices as 'discounts'----for whatever reason, this seems to confuse people.

Major con - the text that is 'hardwired' to the internet sales screens. I'm sure many users would prefer to refer to merchandise as something other than 'tickets.' 'Items' would work great......

Also - The 'description' text for events should have more flexibility insofar as editing is concerned. As it stands now, any text that one posts as a description turns into one long run-on paragraph. It looks a bit tacky.",Overall: Overall? SABO is great. There are a few drawbacks but a LOT of really fantastic advantages. SABO has definitely made my box office life MUCH easier.,

1173,ticketsource,Reliable and efficient,Maxine H.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2017-01-11,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,6.0,"Comments: We have been using Ticketsource for at our theatre for approximately 5 years now. The system works well for our customers who can book seats at a time that suits them and we do not have to be on site to take bookings. As a small venue this is very cost effective for us as we do not have to staff a 24hour box office. Our staff we find the systems straightforward and reliable. We have all the booking details at our fingertips, so we are able to answer customer queries efficiently. Archive materials are easily accessible which makes financial reconciliation straightforward and transparent.

We are able to link directly to our website and can also benefit from the wider Ticketsource community on line.

Ticketsource allows us to customise each event to our own needs allowing us to create tailor made seating plans, pricing structures and booking discounts and incentives. We can add information and publicity material to each performance.

Customer support is very good with a number of options including FAQ's to assist with basic problems, an on line help facility and a telephone help line. The site also includes very helpful tutorials for setting up events and trouble shooting, which are brief and not at all patronising.

Ticketsurce also allows us to run our own box office at strategic times and as much of our business is from schools, dance schools and local amateur companies within a small radius of the venue, it means that customers have the option not to get involved in the extra cost of booking fees.

It would help us greatly as a venue if there were an option to print off whole shows with all the ticket prices on one ticket, as many amateur groups who sell within their own small community like to take possession of all the tickets to sell directly. I am aware that this does not benefit Ticketsource and would make accounting for ticket sales impossible, but many of our clients would prefer to have multiple prices on each ticket, enabling them to highlight the price paid or to cross off the other prices. I'm not sure if other venues would benefit from this service and I fully appreciate that we may be in the minority.

I would certainly recommend Ticketsource to venues of all sizes as it really is a complete package. The rates are reasonable and the support is excellent",,,,

Help is at hand if you don't understand the online instructions. Copying and then amending an existing event to create a new event makes life very easy as you do not have to enter all the regular details each time. Reporting is excellent on both customers and event ticket sales and having emails when there has been a sale is an excellent facility to keep track of progress on ticket sales.,,,,

For a small arts organisation that is always looking for cost-effective solutions, TS has proved invaluable to us. It is easy to use, provides a variety of information in formats that can be exported to our other systems and flexible enough to not only serve as an in-house box office, but also as an on-line customer service which can be managed off-site by our volunteers - everything we need.

Its customer service is truly outstanding. On the rare occasions when we have had to contact them with a technical issue it is resolved quickly and efficiently. Sometimes we have asked for slight changes to made to the system and, when possible, these have always been made.

The only small criticism I would make is with regard to the ticket printer which every now and again stops working. This seems to be caused by a problem with the printer cache which, because it is not on our network, has to be cleared by TS. Again, technical support resolves this quickly and has made suggestions for preventing future problems.",,,,

2. Simple to use system, however we still have issues with the scanners and collation of scanned users

3. Versatile product - but the functionality to allow the client to associate a bar code with a particular seat for Season Ticket holders would be useful. For example we need bar codes printed onto cards before a person has chosen an actual seat.

4. Competition is growing from other similar companies offering to charge ticket commissions of 5% and payments made as they are purchased by the customer - From our company viewpoint we are very happy with Ticketsource but we have to evaluate options, especially commercial ones that serve our customers and cash flow better from a commercial standpoint.",,,,

It has lots of functionality and flexibility which is what we need. The only con I can think of this that it's a bit expensive in terms of the cut Ticketsource take from sales - we're a non-profit / fundraising event and we would have hoped that Ticketsource would have let us keep more of the profits for the charity donations we make from the proceeds of the event.,,,,

1193,ticketsource,Live Music!,Ian S.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,2017-01-11,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"Comments: I've been using Ticketsource for nearly four years with a Live music project in the Yorkshire Dales. the system allows multiple venues to be stored so setting up a gig is as simple as copy event and change the band name. I use a bar code scanner at event which makes entry easy and looks awesome. most of my guests just use the home printed tickets and the system alerts if someone tries to cheat. Support is great, but hardly had had to use it. it works best with wifi access at the venues but can be ran off line if down loaded once online ticket sales close. A great advantage it that cash sales pre event can be entered free of charge for those guests without internet. The only disadvantage is the sales payment is not made until the Wednesday after a weekend event which effects cash flows if you have a expensive band to pay on the night. In conclusion its a fab system which is easy to use and sell tickets online, hopefully I will be using Ticketsource for years to come.",,,,

With their help we were able to sell our tickets with no problems at all. The back of house system worked really well for us, as a company we sell lots of different ticket types and its important to be able to pull off reports, check customers details and doing this with TicketSource was very easy.

We are just starting to accept bookings on line and were very nervous about the things that could go wrong leaving our customers frustrated and angry. I am pleased to say that nothing like this has happened and the feedback we have had so far is very favourable. The reports that are readily available keep us in control of the sales and monitor their progress. The detailed financial reports and the prompt payment of receipts are a boon to our treasurer. I particularly like the way we can integrate the on-line sales with our over the counter sales as many of our older patrons are uneasy about using computers to buy things on-line.

It's pretty simple to use, and a lot of extra functionality has been added since we started using it. Unlike Microsoft, however, they don't completely rewrite the interface every time they make a change! One of the unexpected side-effects of migrating to online ticketing is that, because they can see how many tickets are still available, our patrons often leave it to the last minute before booking, which gives some directors sleepless nights!

In our experience, customer service has been brilliant. We haven't experienced many problems, but any issues or questions raised have alway been dealt with very promptly, and the technical staff seem to very be open to sensible changes requested by their customers.",,,,

The tickets sell well and we can get all the information about our ticket sales and at the end of the sales period the money is transfered to our bank account with no fuss.

We knew that the customers would all arrive in a short period of time so we opted to buy a scanner and use this linked to a downloaded customer database on a laptop.

The system worked fine for 10mins then started to freeze but with a reset worked again. This occurred several times. I'm not sure if it was the laptop or scanner/connection that was at fault but without doing another event will not know.

That aside, the system worked well and the ticket that I made purposely void was met with a loud refusal bleep.

Easy to use, yet powerful! Having used various other and similar event-organiser platform I've always found the set up and final fee structure complicated and difficult to navigate. With Eventsframe it's clear what you get for free and what you are given extra for the premium offering without them trying to hide or slap on extra fees for special deals.

The customer support is top and you can really tell that the people behind the platform have a good understanding f what it takes to run events. They understand the workflow of organising an event and this is represented in the way the support is given. I would definitely recommend EventsFrame to others!","Cons: So far I have not come any Cons. The pricing of the premium could be considered a con by some, but personally I think it's great value for your money. Again the price is just that, no hidden fees. So when you do decide to go with a premium offering you know what you're paying and what you're getting.","Overall: Overall its been a great time saver and has made running or managing event easy.

1534,repairshopr,A great inventory management tool that's easy to use for all employees!,Tanmay M.,Audio Engineer,"Media Production, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2019-03-04,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: What I like most about RepairShopr is the flexibility it allows its users in creating and maintaining varying degrees of inventory items. What if you had 2 products that were ""technically"" the same but varied in price, varied in build quality, etc. RepairShopr allows you to create those categories from the bottom up so you can create as much nuance as needed between various inventory items while abstracting away the ""back end"" of these complex rules to other users. This is great because you can have rather complex ""if then else"" scenarios in play for how certain items are to be used and the program is able to create conditionals that only ""pop up"" certain items which match the complex rules that the administrator can create. This ensures that employees don't need to be told to remember these rules: As long as they work within the system, they will never make a mistake (unless it's human error, of course).","Cons: What I liked least about RepairShopr is the interface to switch between users. It's very easy, while in a rush, to overlook that another user was signed in previously. While a huge portion of that is human error and employees not paying attention, perhaps a little more thought into the user interface would prevent this human error from occurring. Perhaps, adding a picture of the employee's face or some sort of visual avatar would be great so an employee knows that another employee is signed in. I think this, overall, ties into the user interface for RepairShopr which can be somewhat technical and very utilitarian. This isn't a bad thing but a more well thought out user interface that is far more human friendly could be extremely beneficial for users overall.",,
1535,repairshopr,Not just for Retail Computer Shops,Charissa P.,Operations Manager,"Information Technology and Services, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2019-03-02,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: The integration with other programs makes this unstoppable!

This ties a CRM to your POS to your ticketing system. Being able to integrate all of these makes this system one of the most powerful I've worked with. It doesn't feel overbearing either. I worked with Kaseya BMS and Connectwise and both of those felt like beasts. This took a lot of key elements that those two systems have and brought them down to a retail level at a price that all companies should be able to afford.

One of the best parts is that they are always integrating new features and squashing bugs. I was always amazed at how often new useful tools were being added. I'm pretty sure they don't have a huge team, but it felt like there must be hundreds of them with what was being accomplished.","Cons: Integration with Quickbooks Desktop is limited, but Quickbooks online is excellent. I wish it had the ability to map out locations to dispatch technicians too. It will track where your clients are at, but if you are trying to schedule multiple field techs, it would be ideal if you could see specific open tickets on a map (Maybe ones labeled ""Onsite"") and then be able to assign them to technicians based on location.","Overall: If you track inventory, deal with repair tickets, and need to keep up with marketing to your client base, then this is unbeatable. When I was operations manager for a Retail and B2B MSP we switched our retail side from Connectwise to Repairshopr and it was like night and day. It connected quicker, gave us access to our inventory, integrated with Quickbooks online, and gave us custom-ability to really make it fit our business model. As operations manager I was able to build this around our existing processes and make it flow seamlessly.

I now have moved to a telecom that could benefit from this, and the only reason I haven't switched are the two cons I listed. Both of them are offered by Quickbooks own ticketing system.

Don't let their niche market of Retail ISP shops fool you. I've heard of this being integrated into auto shops and other mechanical fields. If you are in a business that dispatches any sort of technician, then this is the product you need.",

-Asset Tracking

-Tickets that are trackable for each customer profile

-Continued updates to enhance the entire product

-Inventory Tracking

-Estimates

-Multiple Integrations with your website for

-Leads and turning those leads in to sales

There are so many features that I want to use but because I stay so busy, I cannot use them all. If this bothers you, you have a plethora of options that you can turn on, or turn off. You can also set each user profile to a specific group, like Tech level 1, Tech level 2, Tech level 3, and assign them each with different access to different things.","Cons: -Lack of scheduling an employee(s) although there is a clock in/clock out feature

-Lack of payroll integration, I have to use a separate program for payroll alone

-Lack of being able to hide certain notes or a specific ticket or customer profile that may be an escalated issue, where you do not want your employees seeing.

-Lack of backup options built in to the plan at no cost, Repairshopr has been very reliable since I have been using it, I am not really concerned about not having this backed up.

I cannot really come up with many cons, this product is great, if you are in the repair business just suck it up and set aside the monthly spend, it pays for itself.","Overall: I have jumped from many different customer management systems, each one does it own unique thing. Repairshopr though has set the bar in my opinion. Repairshopr has really carved out a niche in the repair community. One of the most basic and simplistic things that sold me was the feature that lets you send out a automated email that is customized to say the customers name so it makes it look like you took the time to sit down and write this email. They call this their ""Marketr"" feature. You can actually set it to do any kind of email but where this sold me on Repairshopr was how you can have it follow up with the customer to make sure their repair is doing well and you can set this at different intervals. I have not changed it but by defaults it sends 2 emails asking how things are going the first 2 weeks and then another follow up in 90 days. I am big in to customer service and when I saw this feature, I knew I had to have Repairshopr. The time this saves is indispensable. I have really had a good experience with Repairshopr overall. Down time is almost non-existent. Any issues I have had where I have had to contact support has been really positive. I also like to see that my money is going to a constntly improving product. Everyone I have interacted with at Repairshopr has been wonderful.",

I did a lot of on-site work, so I needed something that was ""cloud"" based so I could log in and make an invoice on the spot. There was no real organization or structure to my invoice system, other than a folder where I would drop paid stuff vs unpaid. RepairShopr changed the way I do business, my ability to track and maintain tickets (which I previously did by hand on paper), and gave me a module to track and follow up with my customers, which I had not been doing previously. What I was doing before worked for me at the time, but once I got RepairShopr I realized how much time I was waisting, and how ""broken"" my system of doing things really was.","Cons: The initial setup was tough; everything has a learning curve, and I'm pretty good at figuring stuff out. Modification of each module and the fields inside the modules took a lot of time to customize to fit my business needs. There are still parts of the software that I am not utilizing to their full capacity, partially because I've never needed to, and partially because I am not sure I want to spend the time to set them up.

That being said, the fact that you can modify each module and field makes the application of this software available to many different markets, not just computer/electronics repair",Overall: Made my life easier!,

We've used other order management systems and this is one of the best systems for what it does. The management software has everything we need to streamline our store from purchase orders, inventory management, check-in/check-out, managing employees, and everything in between. Features are robust and branding can be customized to give customers a great experience while in your store. Post repair, we use the Marketr features and reporting to measure customer satisfaction. Integrates w/ Quickbooks and several apps. Constantly updated with new features and development. Couldn't run our shop without it.","Cons: Most everything I have had issues with over passed on to the development team. I would say time it takes to develop firm specific features, so expanding their API capabilities so outside developers can implement more features.","Overall: RepairShopr staff is great to work with.

In the rare case we need further explanation of a feature or we require support the support team is second to none. Price is very fair for everything it does. Our company completely relies on this product.","Cons: We would like to see the open invoice reminder section be developed. When relying on it for invoicing so heavily, its key to ensure constant communication is occurring between customers with outstanding balance and company. Since it syncs perfectly with quickbooks we have used external programs to handle AR, but it creates a mess of things syncing in terms of data authority.","Overall: Outstanding.

I knew I needed a better workflow system and I needed it to be easy enough for my sub contractors as well. I tried several solutions that didn't workout before I was lucky enough to find Repairshopr. I now rely on RS as the foundation of my business. Every estimate, invoice, contract starts with RS. My team works from all over the country now providing cloud services and we use RS to keep us working together, communicating with clients, invoicing and managing recurring payments with RS third party integrations.","Cons: Honestly, every issue I've ever had has been fixed and even the features I requested in the past have been added...",Overall: I was able to improve my business planning and scale up faster than I ever thought.

1541,repairshopr,Decent software to allow tracking of goods/services with a pretty steep learning curve and certain quirks,Garrett W.,Consultant,"Management Consulting, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,2018-01-18,4,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,"Comments: If you're looking for something with basic inventory tracking, purchasing, and invoicing, RepairShopr is a great place to start. While there is a steep learning curve and the software has it's own quirks and specific ways of doing things (or not doing things), it's very inexpensive in comparison and is very robust. The free version is completely free with no strings attached!","Pros: The free version is pretty much fully functional for our needs. The automated invoices are very professional looking and automate emails when an order is completed (once clicking the proper button on the site). You can keep up with the quantity of goods and keep track with how many are bought and sold over various time periods. The ticketing system works great and it's easy to tell if customers are past due with payments as well. Repeat invoices from month-to-month can be automated which is a HUGE plus and seems to always work! Designed for the IT business, but can be used for anything!","Cons: I rated low in certain aspects because the system is very convoluted compared to other softwares in this space. It seems like it takes extra steps and multiple pages to get to ""checkout."" I have to keep a cheat sheet handy because there isn't a simple way to invoice a customer. It would be nice if all this can be done from one screen, but the user must go to a different webpage for each step. Something else that is aggravating is the way the invoice numbering works. It's automatic and I have yet to find a way to change it. Each invoice can be changed manually, but that takes extra steps as well. None of this may matter to you, and with my subscription being free, I can't complain much. However, if I were paying, this would be something causing me to look elsewhere.",,

However, RepairShopr has recently made several improvements to streamline the layout.","Overall: We needed a better invoicing system to control all aspects or our business (shop repair, on-site repair, contracts and web development). We were using Zoho, but needed better features and tracking. Tried RepairShopr and it totally changed our business. So much more than just invoicing. It's really a full blown business management system and the reporting is excellent.","Recommendations to other buyers: I've had their support team do very specific customization of the API and the end result turned out great.

Inventory comes in and you enter it give it a bar code print label and put it on the shelve. Parts come in you keep count on quantity and know when your running low. The software has an end of day and many other reports like whats selling the best in your store.

If you are a small MSP that handles both business and residential customers and want to fully automate your workflow this is THE product for the job.

The price is better than almost all of the rest, and it has integrations with RMM tools, accounting software, PBX, and a dozen or so more products.

We were able to setup all of our recurring invoices for Antivirus, Backup, Sysem monitoring, email, etc and have the system automatically drop an invoice a the appropriate renewal date - we verify the quantity then send it to Quickbooks and off it goes. Saves us tons of time.

1603,repairshopr,We've switched from Connectwise to Repairshopr last year and never looked back!,Markus H.,Director,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,2016-05-31,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,9.0,"Comments: We have used RepairShopr for 8 months and absolutely love it. We used connectwise prior for 5 years (with a homemade xero link) and have not looked back. We've got 5 staff and do everything from ""classic"" IT to managed and sales. But no retail as such.

The way we're using it is to leave accounting to Xero and all ticketing to RS, which is their respective mainstay. I.e. we push all the ticket invoices to xero (and re-sync them if there are changes) but don't necessarily rely on RS in relation to reconciliation. Let's face it, with credit notes, split payments, etc, etc it's impossible to recon back 100%. Which is why you have an accounting system.

The development team appears to have worked a lot since we joined last September with new features popping up pretty much every week.

Coming from connectwise, training effort and setup was NIL in comparison! The system is easy to use and get used to.

One thing is that it looks like the development of features is faster than the updates to the self-help support system. But support is fast to respond, so that 's a minor issue.",,,,

The recurring invoice feature is also great for our MSP and AV subscriptions.,"Cons: No Square integration. Not a deal breaker by any means, but it would be nice if it was seamless.","Overall: We switched to RepairShopr in May of 2016. We started as a home based business, but the software we were using before was no longer keeping up with our needs when we opened our storefront.",Recommendations to other buyers: Take advantage of the trial!

I think it's decent software for a beginning MSP or break fix shop.,"Cons: This software is buggy. I don't know if we got a bad portal or what, but we're all the time having recurring invoices not process or autobill payments not process. Luckily we reconcile our books religiously, or we'd never know. Support's answer is oops we goofed, but you get to fix it. We've gotten exhausted of their software breaking and sometimes assume it's a bug. When it's not they're quick to point that out but oh so nonchalant when their bugs cost us money--arrogant.",,

I used this platform for 6 months and still did not understand how to do certain things. Click-to-Completion ratio for many features is too high. Platform is NOT intuitive and the KB is outdated.

I like the assets for passwords. Email to the customer after the repair has improved my google ratings. The scheduler is worse and hard to manage for on-site jobs vs. appointment plus. My real gripe is customer support. Virtually non-existent. Customer support either doesn't understand your problem for suggests you get your community to vote for a software update and the community doesn't really do that so it's a bit of a trick. Your report doesn't have amounts on it (virtually useless without) ask the community for a vote for a change. Doesn't do Quickbooks credits. Can't do adjustments like 10% off for a senior discount.

Much like other ticket vendors it all goes sour when you purchase multiple tickets and then get hit with the service fees at the end. Paying service fees for an electronic ticket is absolute bull crap and shouldn't be allowed. Much like Ticketmaster, Ticketfly uses these fees to pad their bottom line and generate revenue. I always suggest purchasing tickets from the venue box office but if you must...ticketfly is as good as the rest at getting you tickets from the convenience of your pc.",

We can easily view how many tickets have been sold and how many are remaining, increase or decrease the number of tickets available, and edit the pricing of tickets. There's also an option to put tickets through as complimentary to book slots for VIP guests.","Cons: There was not an option for voucher discounts, but after contacting Line-Up I was informed that this is currently being developed to be launched in the next couple of months.","Overall: We worked closely with Line-Up as we were developing a new website for our venue and they were incredibly helpful.

1717,bookwhen,BOOKING SYSTEM EXCELLENCE,Kimberlee P.,Company Director,"Health, Wellness and Fitness, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2017-01-16,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Its simple to understand, offers lots of features, its support team is always available.",Cons: Nothing.,"Overall: I considered many different booking systems for my fitness business - but none of them offered the simplicity and user clarity that Bookwhen does. I can create recurring events with customer payment facilities attached easily, run detailed reports to understand booking trends, collect customer information for mail outs. Bookwhen even offers creativity to make the customer facing pages the same colours as my brand, upload my company logo, attachments, feature social media buttons etc.

Bookwhen's own features even prompt me to gear my business in new ways: various ticket types offer the ability to sell to the customer in various avenues, without over-complicating things. Even when I wanted to offer a commission-based element to my business that they didn't already support, I approached the team to see if they would code something specifically to support my business needs and together we made it happen. This sort of service is second to none.

The best part is that anytime I've ever needed support (which is a lot) I can use the instant chat feature, email and even call the support team to get approachable service and considered help.

Within 2 years using Bookwhen my business had grown from a sole trader to a large limited company - without such a fluid booking ability for my customers this would have never been possible.

The subscription price is competitive and the features and service are top notch, I fully recommend Bookwhen.",Recommendations to other buyers: Using this software makes scheduling events and customers payments and reporting easy.

User-friendly, clients find it easy to use and we have never had someone, not book due to the difficulty of the booking system.

Great design - Clean and neat

Does exactly what I need it to do

Excellent support","Cons: Nothing

I think it has more features than I am making full use of!","Overall: I spent months trying to find the perfect booking system to meet my needs. There were many good products on offer, but nothing that gave me what exactly what I was looking for...there was always a compromise somewhere. I then found Bookwhen and it was a perfect fit. It has revolutionized the way we operate our business. It is user-friendly, very easy to navigate both backends and for our guests and it has a great design/layout which matched the look and feel of our website. Bookwhen also offers quick and professional support whenever you need. I was able to share feedback, so when the new system was introduced with the new improvements, I felt that my feedback was taken into account and that we had grown together! It really is a fantastic booking system, our business is running at 100% occupancy and I feel that this is partly due to the ease of online bookings. We will be going into our 5th year with Bookwhen and I cannot recommend it highly enough.","Recommendations to other buyers: I feel I have a personal relationship with the support team and that I am valued. When I am asked to feedback on certain things or when I feel I want to feedback on something specific to the software, then I am heard and where possible when they update the system, these new features are available."

They coordinate a drive up from the south to New England every 2 weeks, and need to register all of the information about the animals (where they're going, their health records, etc) and also assure that each dog has an appropriately sized kennel on the van. It's a little confusing, but because of the nature of the business, it's really important that everything be done safely and efficiently. Bookwhen allows us to set up transports, register the dogs, and take down information not only on the rescue the dog is coming from but also their new home. I use Bookwhen for some other, routine businesses that need yoga classes or other things run, but ultimately what keeps me recommending them for scheduling is that Bookwhen works for complicated businesses who need to take in a lot of info from customers, customers need different ""seats"" (crate sizes) and sometimes other information at intake. Bookwhen allows for _all_ of it, which is the best possible scenario for us.",,"Overall: Super flexible.

We've been using Bookwhen for a couple of years and it has completely changed the way we do things. Attendance lists are easy to create quickly but also to download and manipulate to suit our needs. We love the way you can send links to whole public pages or just specific events. The event reminders are a great help in ensuring people arrive for events or get in touch to say they aren't coming. Customer service is brilliant. We rarely wait more than 5 minutes for a chat response. They listen to our feedback and it been great to be able to influence improvements for ourselves and for other users.,Cons: There are a couple of things we'd like Bookwhen to be capable of but they are fairly minor and the company have already promised to add them to their development plan so I'm pretty confident we'll see changes over the coming months.,,

Also handy features like automatic reminder emails the day before training, and the ability to export the data gathered during booking (email addresses used for follow up material and surveys).","Cons: Nothing, it is easy to use. I suppose there could be some limitations if you have very advanced requirements, but then you probably wouldn't be looking for a service like this.","Overall: Very good. The staff were fantastic, and their support articles were very well set up.",

But this is offset by the excellent customer service - willing to listen to suggestions, always respond quickly to confirm whether your idea is already on their list of things to look at etc...","Overall: Bookwhen has enabled me to run my tiny yoga studio with a lot less stress. I had been thinking of just doing bookings by SMS etc, but within 48 hours, Bookwhen had already demonstrated its value. There is zero chance I would remember everyone's bookings/cancellations/changes if it was done by SMS.

It would be nice if you could customise the public facing page a little more, but for a free package, I'm not complaining!","Overall: Helps us to stay organised when customers book in with us for webinars, consultations and online training sessions.",

I run a small home-based business so it's great that Bookwhen is not and expensive to have.

Excellent Customer Support.

It has all the features that I need.","Cons: I would say that the TROLLEY symbol should be bigger or a CART function needs to be applied as when some customers want to make multiple bookings, they don't always notice the trolley symbol near the class and so they book and pay for each class seperately. This causes an inconvenience.","Overall: It's easy to use, affordable, has great features and customer support is always great.",

Responsive to ideas and features users need. Decent payment portal transfers and option. Discount features/options for users.",Cons: Back end could always have a few tweaks here and there. Mobile layout for block bookings could be a tiny bit clearer.,"Overall: I've been using bookwhen since its first iteration for my coaching business after looking around for the best balance of affordability and features. Throughout my use the support team has been there every step of the way, when I've found issues or got myself confused they've responsed FAST always looked into and solved my problems.","Recommendations to other buyers: If you're looking to an affordable, straightforward booking system for adbanced bookinga for classes, courses, shows or anything of that nature. I can't recommend this enough."

The 'new' version is very easy to use with a great looking customer interface. There are a couple of things that could be improved or added but the team are always welcome to feedback. Very happy and suits my small business perfectly!,"Recommendations to other buyers: Wish you could make your homepage a bit more customised - other than just a picture, e.g. layout etc. Would be nice to add on features such as wait list or reminder emails as a payable extra e.g. Lite plan but pay an extra å£2 a month for wait list. As a small business I can't warrant the cost of the next plan up when it's not necessary but it would be nice to have the features that come with it."

Groups of bookings is possible, continual bookings and course bookings are available.",Cons: I would like to be able to see past bookings for longer periods of time.

I like to use the voucher system but don't think I get the most out of it because I don't know how.",Cons: I really want to have reminders and waiting lists but will never need the extra bookings or admins so the package is limiting for my use.

It is simple for my customers to use and although it has taken me a while to get all of my information on and work my way round the system (but then don't they all?) it does everything I need it to do. The help service is really good, offering help articles, live chat or on the phone. They are UK based and real quick to respond.","Cons: Just the time it took to work it all out, but all the other trials I did were the same, I don't think there is any quick fix!","Overall: Brilliant, exactly what I was looking for.",

Bookwhen has been an excellent low cost option that meets my needs well. My customers can pay online if they want, they can see my scheduled classes and the details and locations for those classes.","Cons: Just minor things: There is a little bit of confusion when there is the option to pay at class - the checkmark to pay later is kind of buried for the user. Also, some of the more advanced scheduling could be a little smoother, but overall it's very good.",,

Both in terms of viewing a list of all people on the wait list without having to scroll through all bookings and in terms of contacting them and booking them into a different time slot.,"Overall: As a small non-profit ticketing software can be overly expensive for our organization. Bookwhen offers a great product that meets our needs at an affordable price. There customer service is fantastic, they are very helpful and we found them to be quite responsive. They continue to add new features each year which has given us additional functionality. Highly recommend this product!!!",

It's also easy for coaches to check on class attendance and it's veratile enought that we can use it for all of our needs.,Cons: Its clunky to keep track of cash payments and doesnt have a dedicated page for taking register once the class begins.,"Overall: Dont underestimate Bookwhen. A tiny application compared to some other software booking packages but it's versatile, powerful and great to use. My clients find booking easy and repeat bookings even easier. I'm very happy with it.",Recommendations to other buyers: It's easily the most cost effective software on the market. At a fraction of the cost of GoTeamUp or MindBody but a realistic competitor.

I find adding classes or changes times easy to do. Email confirmation is fantastic, also easy option to cancel. The help I have been given by their team has been second to none. I always recommend Bookwhen when people ask about it.",Cons: When I started I had the waiting list option and someone on list would be contacted if a place became available. I cannot afford that any more as my business is very small and I don't earn enough to have that.,Overall: I am not constantly getting telephone calls to book classes and then have to do so. People can book as far in advance as they want - which is useful for a popular class as I can only have six people in a session.,

There are a few minor functionalities that I would like it to have like a client notes section but the team know about this and add it to their list of modifications for the future.

The CSV file it provides me does not give me the exact MI I need so I am having to adapt to it. That said I have not spoken to the team about it so maybe it can be resolved.",,

If I accidentally click on our own account link, I can't sign in as admin, so I have to re-enter the general Bookwhen page to log in. Also, when we send customers a link to our page, it seems to send them in to one particular time slot, and the less logical among them don't realise they need to press back to get out to all the available booking slots.","Overall: We run a sling library for local parents, holding three sessions each month. We're volunteers doing it for free. We were finding that far too many families were turning up for us to deal with, meaning they had to wait ages to see us, and we were stressed, run off our feet, and running over time, ending up late to collect children from school and nursery. We set up a Bookwhen account so we could organise the sessions (so everyone doesn't arrive at 11am) and set a maximum number of available slots. It's made a really positive impact... we no longer dread busy sessions and customers know they won't have to wait long.",

Sometimes we don't even know of an issue, and it's already remedied, and we are made aware ASAP. They take wonderful care of us and listen to all of our questions and ideas.","Cons: When we first decided on Showare, there were a few reports and capabilities that Showare did not perform, that we were used to having. Instead of turning us away, they listened to us and helped us create a new report for our needs. Additionally, there have been things that we thought would be great additions to the system, not only for us, but to other venues as well. A few upgrades later...there they were!","Overall: User-friendly, easy to navigate, up to date software, great upgrades, amazing customer service.",

When we initially planned to use the system, the training was beyond what I've experienced with any other vendor. Our employees were initially a little intimidated by such a powerful system but once they realized how easy it really is to use, they LOVE it! We have employees who look forward to selling tickets on ShoWare because it is so easy and so intuitive. We are not a huge venue...as an HOA we bring in individual shows as well as season packages. We see the value because we are able to market to residents as well as the surrounding community using ShoWare. We also love the fact that upgrades are regularly introduced with advance notice. We looked at a variety of ticketing options but ShoWare won hands down. Post go-live, their customer service continues to be a winner in our book! And, yes, I love ShoWare as a customer too!","Cons: We needed a system which could accommodate the various seat maps and configurations we use as well as sell season tickets to patrons. If what you need is general admission ticketing for one or two events, this software would be overkill.","Overall: Training, flexibility, excellent customer service and value, value, value!",

Box Office associates and patrons alike find it very easy to navigate. After our venue decided to make some big changes to the seat numbering over the summer, our client services rep was very thorough and patient in helping me navigate through the process. What could have been a cumbersome project was made much easier due to his efforts.","Cons: A lot of patrons forget passwords/change email addresses, etc. and create new accounts instead updating their current account(s). I would love to be able to merge duplicate patrons accounts together.","Overall: We our very pleased with the software and appreciate the team at accesso ShoWare! Items such as setting up multiple dynamic pricing changes in advance and being able to hit ""enter"" after a keyword search (which might seem minor) are small pieces of continuous upgrades that are huge time savers and continue to grow our excitement for the product.",

The fees are affordable, and the ease of use is unbeatable. We love the customer service they provide us too. Our patrons can pick their seats, make donations, and search our schedule with ease. Our staff can ring sales, take orders, and print tickets seamlessly. We would (and often do) recommend it to anyone.",,"Overall: We have seen more patrons, more effective marketing strategies, faster sales, and many more benefits from this software.",

Ease of use once learned. The many features that have the ability to drive revenue.,"Cons: The data entry fields do not auto fill with proper punctuation on the web/back end. ie, capitalized first name, hyphens in phone #'s etc. Not all reports are downloadable. There is not one report that has comprehensive information ( info from patron order address report and ticket buyer report would be helpful)",,

The flexibility the system and the support team has for our unique style of selling tickets has been quite a blessing.,"Cons: As with most systems, the inability to change the delivery method on a completed order and not being able to do a partial refund seamlessly can be a bit of a burden. Thankfully these scenarios don't come into play too often and we can work around them.",Overall: ShoWare is a great product for any venue looking for an easy system to use that allows the ability for the Box Office management to create and control their events. This take the stress off of relying on another entity to create your manifests and hope they finish on time.,

It's easy to track current sales and report on them later. The recent updates to the software have made huge strides towards ease of use and flexibility. We have very active patrons and the servers never get overloaded so everyone leaves happy and with tickets. Our account manager is extremely communicative. He checks in on us and monitors every sale. We couldn't do it without him!,Cons: Set up is tedious if working with a tour of multiple venues. It's not hard but it does take time to set up each individual seat map. I would love if we could update seat maps after they're applied to a performance. Otherwise well done!,Overall: Our ticket selling process has streamlined and is now a no stress experience. We never worry about our sales running without a hitch. That peace of mind is invaluable to us as manage ticket access to the fans of some of the biggest musicians in the industry.,

The help tab gears you in the right direction when you need that quick refreshing of how to do or understand something your forgot.","Cons: One thing I can say I would like to see an update on is when patrons enter a code, and the prices automatically change instead of using a drop box which to many can become very confusing, especially to elderly or non computer users.",,
1866,accesso_showare,Showare is a great value for the money,Steve F.,Chief Executive Officer for Patron Services,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,2018-11-28,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,Pros: The ease of training new people on the system. Our patrons love the online purchase procedure. The ease of setting up a season and individual shows for sale. The reports cover almost everything you can imagine and you can also have them customize reports (at a cost of course) but it is well worth the value.,"Cons: I mentioned the reports are great, but there is always room for improvement and could always add more reports as you never know what you are going to need next.",Overall: Selling ticket on line and up selling to the patrons as they are buying one show and might be interested in other upcoming shows. Our accountant is much happier with the reports and the ease of use pulling information from the system to balance the daily books.,

I'm a quick learner so it was easy to learn to system and for me to train volunteers and other members of our team. They've had two updates so far since I've been using it. Updates are always fantastic. I love the advertising possibilities both onsite and confirmation email.,"Cons: We sell tickets for different events (promoters), and not necessarily a venue. These promoters have volunteers, which we call committee members, sell tickets on their behalf directly from their mobile phone (cash transactions), if this system had that feature, I will blow my competition out of the water, along with the other features, as the touchscreen only works well for tablets.

Some of the reports are only view only and cannot be downloaded.",,

The ease of use has reached a wonderful level. It is so easy to train new employees on the system. As upgrades are added they have usually been easy to understand and easy to integrate into our daily use.,Cons: Most cons are really only small issues here and there. They have mostly been resolved over time. No major cons at this point!,,

The newer features where I can adjust a seat map for a specific show without it affecting the seat maps of other shows using the same seat map is helpful.,Cons: I wish there was a full map seat selection view both within the box office and for the customers to navigate more easily.,Overall: It is easy to quickly train staff and provide notes within the Box Office tab to guide them with notes for each show.,

So many companies don't have any sort of customer service or if they do they don't have someone who will pick up the phone.

I know I can call Customer support if I have a question and he's always there to help me out. I've been using ShoWare for many years and it only gets better with every improvement and feature add.","Cons: It does take a good bit of training to get comfortable on the system, but that's to be expected as ticketing is a complicated process. It's a little more complicated for a touring artist than it would be for a venue with the same few seating charts but we've been able to make it work for our purposes without any big issues.",,

It feels like we've only scratched the surface of the amount of detail we can utilize.

We are a general admission daily attraction, and so unlike most of accesso ShoWare's usual clientele. In that regard, they have been great at working with us and helping us adapt the system to our needs. They are quick to offer solutions and check up to see how things are going. Any functionality problems we've had have been quickly solved.

With that in mind, the ease of use of accesso ShoWare for us as a general admission attraction suffers a bit- the amount of bending and adapting we've had to do to make accesso ShoWare work for our needs has created a steep learning curve for Box Office staff as some of the functionality is not necessarily intuitive for what we do. As with any system that's not custom made, there are functions we would wish for but that's to be expected.

We're looking forward to the next year of accesso ShoWare.",,,,

However accesso ShoWare does come close in many ways. It's overall a user friendly product, easily teachable to use to ever changing staff if your a University. Like all web based ticketing systems the adjustments that you may need to make if an error is made in certain modules can be a bit frustrating. This is where accesso Showare's 5 Star Customer Service shines through. Not only is the account management team knowledgeable , efficient, and friendly. The company as a whole is firmly dedicated to improving the product based on the actual needs of their clientele. I find that very refreshing. Although not all input is able to be incorporated. accesso Showare's production team will keep it in mind for future releases and you may be very pleasantly surprised to see your venue idea added to a broader upgrade feature.

I think there is a lot of potential with marketing upcoming shows via the online ticketing and Facebook that we haven't tapped yet. On the back end, I am disappointed with the gift certificate system--or lack of--so I'd love for that to be improved. I also wish there was a way to regulate how many tickets are printed with each order (a header and a receipt aren't always necessary) to prevent wasting excess ticket stock.

We knew in taking the product that it was still a bit young and had room to grow. The fact that it is a growing product is what gives it both pros and cons. There are a lot of nice features already, but there is still room for improvement in terms of reporting, ease of checkout, and fund development.

They have amazing customer support with almost immediate response and the help section is fantastic. The on-line program for auction items is a tremendous feature. This gave us the opportunity to market our auction items in advance of the event and create a buzz. We love the ability to be able to pull up past donations and have the fields autofill - that saved a lot of work the second year we used the software. We also love the scheduled communications. We scheduled an e-mail 2 days prior to the event to go to all attendees with information on parking, dress, etc., as well as an e-mail 2 days after the event thanking people for attending. Lastly, we LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the e-mail/text notification for auction winners. So many people have commented on how much they appreciate this feature.","Cons: I will say there were a few quirks with ticket purchasing. We had 2 couples buy tickets and have receipts but they were not in the software anywhere. This happened last year as well. Silent Auction has yet to find out why this happened, but overall the ticketing system works well. Since this quirk happened the first year we had a ""back up"" plan if it happened to anyone this year and how we would handle it. I wish the site was more clear about security of the site and that the credit cards are going through the paypal system, not our computers. Some people get funny about buying items on-line and we have had a few of these instances/complaints. I also wish it was more clear when someone was buying multiple tickets that the first ticket was going to the buyer - and if the buyer was buying tickets for someone else they could change this in the system if they were not attending or already purchased their ticket. I wish there was a way to modify the bid sheet layout. I think the site could easily become more user friendly by creating buttons for some commonly used things - such as create a donor, create a donation - instead of links buried down in the page. So many of the links look similar and can get confusing for people that are not using the software on a regular basis.","Overall: I would love to see the other side of the database developed - the expense side. I would like to be able to run true reports revenue verses expenses. I wish Silent Auction Pro would have additional fields that could be labeled however the customer needed them - similar to creating different types of tickets but for other needs related to auction items. Lastly, I have only one complaint about the cost. I understand and accept the cost and 2% for auction items, however, it doesn't seems fair to have the charity pays 2% of the cost of a consignment item (ie. trip, autographed album cover) that cost $1000's of dollars. The charity ends up paying silent auction pro most of the profit they make on the item if they only make a couple of hundred of dollars over the consignment price. I believe the 2% should be on what the charity makes net on the auction not gross.",
1901,silent_auction_pro,Excellent Choice,Lara K.,Executive Director,Hospital & Health Care,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,2017-10-07,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: This is terrific software, especially for a smaller nonprofit. What sold the software to us is that when I inquired about it online on a Saturday, I got an immediate phone call from the owner of the company and software developer. This was very typical of all interaction with this company throughout our use of the software - we got immediate responses from support when we had questions, they understand that auctions happen on weekends and support needs to be available then, and when we found a few quirks in the software they were repaired immediately, often by the developer personally. We previously used Greater Giving and BidPal; all three have features that I like and don't like, but overall SilentAuctionPro is by far the best value for the price. The a la carte pricing is a huge benefit for nonprofits like ours that cannot use all features (i.e. online bidding). Overall, from last year to this year (BidPal to SilentAuctionPro), we went from about 100 to 195 attendees, and from our worst checkout ever to our best. The instruction files, help menus, videos, etc were by the far the best of any nonprofit software we have used. We were invoiced after the auction for the software, which could be of great benefit for a nonprofit just starting out with their first auction.","Cons: I would love to be able to have a website where people can enter their own donations and have them populate as donation items in the system. There were a few quirks like the system not liking quote marks and ampersands. I would like for there to be a bit more explanation on the page about the security of registering your card as many of my guests weren't comfortable doing so at the time of ticket purchase. It would also be great to have more customization options for the ticket sales page. Because of the way we run our auction, I would very much prefer to be able to assign bidder #s to a household rather than to an individual, but this would have been fine if we had noticed it earlier and planned accordingly. I would also like to be able to customize a bit more on the receipts, include ticket descriptions, etc. I would have set up our fixed price items differently than we were advised to as I don't think it was the best option for our auction and was a bit of a hiccup, but in fairness it was something we didn't get to in advance and did on the fly, so it would have been avoidable with a little planning. Although the reports are generally pretty great, I did have to piece together a few to get to what I needed which could be a pain for someone with less Excel experience. Really minor, but because we can't use online bidding, I print our bidsheets on carbonless paper. Would very much prefer that the half sheet option printed as a 2up because I ended up reformatting them in Adob","Overall: Helped us run our best auction to date, with virtually no line at checkout, even though we had almost doubled our attendees from the prior year.",
1902,silent_auction_pro,Tremendous system for making charity auction easier to set up,Charisse B.,Committee member/volunteer,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,2017-05-06,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Donation entry was intuitive and loved that we could pull up items donated before so that we didn't have to retype everything. Demo environment allowed us to get committee members up to speed quickly and also allowed us to practice on some creative set up to meet our auction needs. Ticketing feature offered a variety of ticket options, some only displaying with a promo code, and love the addition of the asking for the email address for a ticket purchasers' guests - made it simple to reach all attendees with the marketing tools. Allowing the ticket purchasers to select the meal, or any other item we programmed made the table/catering coordination easy. Marketing features to promote the event to our attendees as well as help them feel connected to the event that was a couple months away. We set up an online auction the week before our event and people loved it! The online auction was open to the public so it allowed parents to share with friends and family that weren't planning on attending. We posted the event auction items on the online auction as previews to entice bidders to attend to get a chance at the rest of the silent and live items. Reporting is good, check in/out is all on one page, the system performance is great. Loved working in system even from our smart phone browser to check on things, make changes etc. any time, any where. Customer support was outstanding!","Cons: Special characters aren't allowed in donation title so we had to change once they got loaded as an auction item. Special characters in the description like "" for inch threw off the formatting of the data export to excel. Reporting is good, but would have liked a few more reports or the ability to create ad hoc reports. We found one report provided this item, but another report provided this item so we had to export to excel and do look up functions which is tedious to do each time. Would like more options for formatting of bid sheets, and also would like to see some additional options with displaying, leveraging the ""Donation Tag"" feature which is critical for us as our teams need to be identified. Would like filters on lists as well.",Overall: Set up and run the event solely from volunteer committee without having to contract with other services for ticketing or check in/out. Handle high volume auction and attendee counts with smaller committee.,

Loved the phone call the day before the event to share the 800 number. Love that we can email receipts to winners. Love that we can notify winners via email or text once a table is processed. Like that you can have multiple users at same time, especially at event day, doing data input, checking in bidders, checking out winners.","Cons: 1) Certain characters are not liked by the program (inch symbol, & symbol), especially when exporting to excel. 2) Bid sheet area to write in bids is too crowded, would like options to modify bid sheet layout, not sure if we can or not but would like opportunity to export bid sheets to a file and add ""NO BIDS"" on back side of page 3) Price went up from last year, both module cost and %. 4) Would like more options to print vs export and when exporting to design what fields and sort order, especially on sold items 5) Dont like that when you create duplicate items that they are linked and then if one is not sold it cannot be deleted without deleting them both 6) When you update an auction item, you go back to the donation, update, then update auction item. It does not always take the updated title from the donation as the new title of the auction item. Cannot figure out why. 7) would like the name on the bid sheets to be larger font, as we had two bidders get the wrong cards and not know that it was not their name at the top 8) Would like bidders to write more clearly :) (I know, out our your control) 9) Would like a quicker way to see what auction items have no bids at the end of the event instead of scrolling through the page","Overall: Silent Auction Pro allows us to manage a high volume of donators, donations, auction items, bidders, etc. Customer support is great, they are always available to answer my questions timely.

1905,silent_auction_pro,Silent Auction Pro Thought of Everything!,Stephanie D.,Volunteer Event Chair,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2016-05-10,5,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,7.0,"Comments: Overall, I am extremely pleased with this software. I was totally immersed in it, learning every possible feature and application, to ensure that we got the maximum use.

Pro's:

1. The Help section is extremely well documented, and the customer support is amazing. The You Tube videos were very helpful for training both me and my volunteers. Any time of the day or night when I sent an email, I had an immediate response.

2. The options available were extremely comprehensive and knowledgeable about the mechanics of a benefit fundraiser. I cannot think of anything that I wanted to do that I couldn't do. From donor setup, to bidding styles (purchase of ticket parties for Teacher Experiences, to Silent Auction bidding, setting different minimum bids etc) to performance tracking, exporting info, everything was there.

3. The buzz that we created with the auction was definitely a boost to our event. We doubled our attendance vs. last year, just by starting the auction 4 weeks before the event, and creating excitement about the items that we offered early.

4. I am now set up for next year, with over 50% of the input work established already (donors, pictures and logos, bidders, etc). Next year should be a lot easier!

5. Auction Day section is powerful and easy to use - The check in was easy, online bidding was easy, and checkout was VERY easy, especially for those who had already registered their credit cards online. I could just click ""auto process"" for a batch of auction items, and with a click of the button, 20 people were checked out at once. Then I just looked up the auction number, passed out the gift envelopes or baskets, and done!",,,,

And, I was able to enjoy the actual event for the first time.","Cons: Not really a con, but a suggestion if you use this software: have a designated person in charge of using the software and train everyone to enter the information consistently. I think their best practices was helpful'it saves time to make sure you take that step so you don't have to edit a bunch of things later.","Overall: Before finding Silent Auction Pro, we were doing everything by hand. It took up a lot of everyone's time and led to a lot of frustration. After a very stressful night of having people waiting for us to hand calculate their winning bids and asking us every five minutes if we were ready, we decided there must be a better way to do this. A fundraiser should be fun! It has fun in the name! So I found Silent Auction Pro. It made such a difference to not have all of those people waiting for us to give them their winning items and invoices. And, checking out was quick. I highly recommend for events like silent auctions.","Recommendations to other buyers: This was a learning curve piece that I will share: sell tickets through silent auction pro'there isn't a charge to do it (we had already printed postcards and were selling tickets at the school so I didn't think about it the first time). If you sell the tickets using silent auction pro, all of the info is stored so you don't have to enter it later and it is much easier to track everything and the ticket purchasers don't even have to check in."

The extras are great:logos & pictures for displays, the communication tool saved us & we were able to message our bidders with auction highlights.","Cons: After our 2nd event, the system usage seemed more intuitive. We didn't realize how many features we could have used that first time! Would love the system to accept AmEx, not just Visa/MasterCard.","Overall: Three years ago was the first time we used SilentAuctionPro. And we used it again for this year's event.

1909,silent_auction_pro,Silent Auction Pro is the BEST value available with amazing customer support!,Amy J.,Nonprofit Consultant,"Non-Profit Organization Management, Self-employed",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,2016-10-19,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,Pros: It is intuitive and and easy to learn. Support team is very responsive and is constantly updating the product. It offers the absolute BEST value of any auction software I have used or researched! The mobile product is clean and user-friendly.,"Cons: Some of the functions are a bit hard to find. You do have to be a self-starter to research all of the functions and know exactly what is needed before the gala night to check in, check out, and close the auctions. I had to contact customer support several times throughout the evening for assistance.","Overall: As a nonprofit consultant, I have worked with a variety of nonprofit organizations on their gala auctions. I recommended Silent Auction Pro to a nonprofit pre-school for their gala. We utilized all of the features offered by SAP, including a live and silent auction, the mobile feature and the event planning features with a very user friendly table assignment function. The product is very responsive and intuitive, and helped this organization raise over $79,000 above sponsorships and ticket sales the night of the gala!","Recommendations to other buyers: Start very early to learn the product and do all of the research. Work in their Sandbox demo and do a mock event training with committee members well before the event. Make sure you have plenty of people to do different functions - a separate cashier at check-in and throughout the event. Several committee members are needed to procure, enter auction donations and help package them. Another committee should be responsible for reservations, seating, and check-in."
1910,silent_auction_pro,Sheboygan Service Club,Heather C.,Foundation Treasurer,Fund-Raising,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,2016-11-30,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,,"Pros: Silent Auction Pro helped our auction and operations team see data (auction items, ticket purchases) on a real-time basis. Previously, we relied on spreadsheets and emails, and version were easily confused and confusing. It was also great to tally up totals at the end of the evening quickly to make a grand total announce while all guests were present.","Cons: This was our organization's first time using mobile bidding and it was received with mixed reviews. It was confusing for some to login if they didn't receive an email. We will collect emails at registration next year to make it smoother. The QR codes on the items were great, but most guests did not already have the app on their phones. It was difficult, at times, to scroll through items. Lastly, it would be great to have a cross reference for ""baskets"" by individual. We weren't sure why the numbers continued from 2015 rather than starting fresh for the new event.","Overall: Silent Auction Pro is a powerful tool for fundraising events. Login is smooth for past members and new members of the organization. Once you're on the site for some time, it's neat to see all the various ways data can be sorted and viewed. Mobile bidding was an interesting transition for our group and guests, but I think it will become smoother every year. The software has made tasks for the auction and operations team smoother every year with the saved data. It was great to see our member's work real-time, so we knew where we were at for auction items and ticket sales. It's also great to have the data saved in one spot from year to year.","Recommendations to other buyers: If you group will be going with the mobile bidding, try to post items in advance and have folks sign-up to the site in advance. If this happens, guests will spend less time at the event looking at their phone and trying to figure it out."

It's superb. Being a rotating group of volunteers, we don't always have the technical know-how to manage the software right out of the gate each year, but the team at SAP really helps get us there by being available, knowledgeable, and clear with their guidance. Other pros: the functionality is robust, allowing us to do everything we need (set up online, silent, and live components of our auction, plus sell raffle tickets and track a fund-a-need). The platform is well organized and easy to navigate.","Cons: It does take some time up-front to learn the software and all that it can do.

In years past, our annual elementary PTO Fundraiser and Silent Auction was a tedious process. We would create our Bid Sheets and Display Sheets on separate programs. We would have another person create our event programs. Our donations would be logged in an Excel Spreadsheet. We would have ticket sales go through the office secretary. It wasn't seamless and it wasn't efficient. The checkout process at the event was also a mess as we didn't pre aucthorize credit cards and would have weeks of clean up trying to collect money from bidders who left without paying.",

So when it came for me to organize an event, I pushed for using Silent Auction Pro mobile bidding though we were uncertain that our clientele would be receptive. Post the event, the response was almost all positive, they loved bidding on their mobile devices and we made much more money from our silent auction. We particularly loved the automated winner text notification and giving them the opportunity to self check-out/pay, making it all so much faster and easier. From the point of view of the auction administrator, it made my life much easier with no last minute pulling an all nighter to produce bidding sheets, etc. The customer service was superb and personalized. Someone always answered my calls, no matter the hour and helped resolve the issue(s) I was having or if they couldn't, they referred it to the developer who is the owner and soon afterwards all was resolved. I loved the reminders ahead of the event to ensure all was moving along smoothly and the personal calls to check in were very much appreciated. I felt fully supported at every step.",Cons: It was definitely challenging learning a new system but it was worth the time and effort. There were a few little quirks that need resolving and these I have shared with the developer.,Overall: I would definitely recommend using this software to others and will use again myself. There is no doubt that we brought in more money using Silent Auction Pro. Pay attention to detail on the front side and the event will run seamlessly.,

We were able to track our history of donors and popular items, and streamlined our request process to focus on what bidders really wanted. Selling tickets to the event became a much easier process as well. The software was intuitive, and the customer service was great.","Cons: While we loved our experience with Silent Auction Pro, we eventually felt we needed to switch companies to a platform that allowed for public searches of online auctions, rather than requiring a link and approval from an Auction Chairperson. We switched to another company in order to take advantage of a large and searchable/public auction community. However, that switch has cost us much more money. Instead, a strong marketing campaign on social media would bring the extra bidders without paying the more expensive subscription fee that the other company charged us. I will encourage the next Auction Chairperson to use Silent Auction Pro.",Overall: Silent Auction Pro completely changed the way we ran our annual silent and live auction. It took us out of the time-consuming task of tracking everything by Excel worksheets and allowed us to focus more on the actual fundraising.,

We have been able to grow our bidders and this helps grow the auction revenue! The software is easy to use and simple for the bidder to get started and follow their bids. It is also very easy to close out the auction quickly and securely. Customer Support is excellent!

There are many features which make this very easy. The check-out system is pretty user friendly and works well. The support staff at SAP are great to answer questions and lead you through the process.,"Cons: The first ticket purchase by a buyer only allows for the purchasers name, and does not let you reassign the name to someone else right away - you have to go back in and readjust. It worked but is a little bit clunky.

A lot of data entry. As we were using this for the second time, some bits were easier as we could pull from past donors info.

The bid sheets selected the donations that were entered first, which were not always the biggest selling points when bundling

Setting up the bar tickets was a bit messy.

Would be nice to be able to pull more specified reports from the program. Customize the report formats.","Overall: Once you play around with the program, it seems to be pretty user friendly.

It is a fairly complex bit of software, so the first-time user may be a little daunted by all the options, but the support staff is always (And I do mean pretty much Always) available to explain things, and to help you figure out any issues. They can log in and look at your event with you, and give you real feedback, rather than just general suggestions, which is a huge help. The video instructional resources are also much more helpful that a printed set of instructions and are available on YouTube. It gave us a way to quickly determine how much we had made and which categories of items did the best. We also got a summary of who still hadn't paid for their items.",,,,

We have a silent and live auction portion and this program works perfectly for all our needs. There are still even more cool features that if we took the time to look through a bit, we could make things run even more smoothly (i.e. notifying winners of their winning bids, creating thank you cards for afterward, etc.)",Cons: It'd be nice if we could change font size on bid sheets - we have an elderly clientele and I know the sheets might be hard to read for them.,"Overall: Silent Auction Pro is easy for anybody to ""pick up,"" which is good since the team running the auction has an almost yearly turnaround. Also, the customer support is phenomenal, if and when I do need to talk to someone about features.",

It will be nice if you can add more image in the registration page to at least match the event website. Data archive is very limited. You have to back-up data after each event, otherwise, it's gone. They're very good in sending reminders, however, having the data archive for future use provides convenience and assurance that at least you have a copy or your data in Silent Auction Pro.","Overall: The software is very simple and easy to use. There are features and functionality that can be improved, however, overall the whole process save you time and money. Highly recommended for fundraising events.",

We started using it because it was the most cost effective way to take people's credit cards ahead of time for a more expedited check out process. Our board still doesn't want to go totally electronic, so we use it to sell tickets, to prepare the bid sheets for silent auction items, and to run the checkout process from our paper-based silent auction.",,,,

As the Auction Administrator, I found the system to be intuitive and well-labeled. There was no searching and clicking through pages and pages to try to find what I needed. It is all presented clearly on the home screen that has a few clearly labeled tabs that will take you directly to whatever you need. The system can be tailored to your needs - we wanted only online/mobile bidding and we did not need card readers. So - we only selected what we needed and did not have to pay for any whistles and bells that weren't necessary. We were able to easily create an online catalog with photos and descriptions of each auction item, and we were able to paste the URL of the catalog onto our social media sites and into emails, therefore driving up the public interest in the event. We were able to have attendees pre-register, so when they arrived there were no long lines at the check-in table. Check-out went smoothly, too. All you have to do to process a check-out is to enter a bidder number. It generates a list of items and you simply confirm that you want to use the credit card already in the system (or cash/check if the person wants to pay in that manner). It's that simple. I received helpful emails from support staff alerting me to ""best practices"" and ""timelines"" without even asking. These emails helped to keep the auction planning on track and really identified potential trouble spots before they happened. There are tutorials/training videos built into the software, so training support staff is easy - you do not have to create your own manual or training sessions, it's done for you!",,,,

Every time I called for questions or help, I spoke with a handful of extremely helpful, skilled experts in the software that walked me through every step of the way. This customer service is head and shoulders above any I have ever experienced before! They went over and above my expectations!",Cons: I can honestly say I can't offer any negatives. It exceeded my expectations in every way.,"Overall: I have just recently organized my first charity auction fundraiser using Silent Auction Pro. As a complete novice, I found tremendous value in their free whitepaper full of incredibly helpful best practices for organizing auctions. We evaluated three software programs and went with Silent Auction Pro because it completely met our needs at a very reasonable price. It was available in several components we could pick and choose from to pay only for what we needed. For example, our audience wasn't ready for the online bidding capability, so we did not have to pay for that set of features. (With a younger attendee base, I would have jumped at the online component.) I found the software incredibly easy to use and got up to speed quite quickly. It was also very easy to train my auction support staff and the company offers a number of great YouTube training videos to help with that.",Recommendations to other buyers: Don't look any further. You will not find another program that delivers the value of Silent Auction Pro at the price point and level of support.

I also like that checkout takes a lot less time and the customers like getting a receipt. The ability to print and check all the items from a donation or auction item perspective is so helpful when setting up. I also like the email feature so we can send messages to our patrons and Thank you notes to our donors. The ability to text winning bid status is fun too. Having the patrons credit card information helps make check out a breeze even if they are not present at the time of close out of the auction.,"Cons: Minor glitches with downloading to excel if you use that option. Easy to clean up though. There is a lot to learn to get going with the software but once you understand it, it is easy to use and the customer service is excellent.",Overall: Saves us so much time. Used to use excel and mail merge to create bid sheets. Then had to enter results into a shared Sheet. Checkout took a lot longer since had to search the sheet. Also never had an online presence before so this gives us access to more people.,

Our school auction has gone from completely paper based, to silent auction with software, and then to mobile bidding over the past four years. Silent Auction Pro walked us through this process, helping us through each transition. The customer support we received was phenomenal.

I recommend this company to anyone looking for an affordable, easy to use system. It was user-friendly for both our attendees and our check-in/check-out staff. The training and support received before the event was excellent, and (the INCLUDED) technical support staff went above and beyond the night of the event when we had a few users that had trouble with the system (which turned out to be simple password errors and nothing to do with the SAP software). We used a different software company in 2016 - it was ridiculously expensive, complicated to use and technical support was NOT included, but could be purchased for another astronomical amount. SAP had REAL people call us to touch base, they kept in contact with emails, and everything we wanted was included in this system.

Some of my favorite features are the reporting, easy navigation and setup features that were used for our online ticket sales. We did not use the bid number feature but have learned from this year; we will want to use that feature next year. Silent Auction Pro makes everything so easy. However, the one thing that makes them outstanding is their customer service. Anytime I had a question, they were there and they were there with the answer I needed.","Cons: There is not a perfect software for anything, everyone knows that. There are a couple little things I would like to see differently but we will work together to come up with a solution for those items before the next event!","Overall: Benefits from this software is hands down the customer service. Silent Auction Pro is extremely professional, reliable and overall a fantastic software with a fantastic staff. The customer service is the best, especially when you talk to them several times on the day of your event.

I also like that it keeps track of who donates each item and which account it goes into at the end.","Cons: Having to take each item from a D to an A number seems like too many steps.

The support from the Silent Auction Pro team is top notch!",Cons: Some of the screens are too busy but once you get used to the software it's fine.,"Overall: I've used other silent auction software in the past. Silent Auction Pro is so much better than the other system. What makes it better?? Cost, ease of use, and most importantly support! I can't say enough about the on-going support that we receive from the Silent Auction Pro Team. We've used Silent Auction Pro for two events now, both have been a success. Each event gets better and each year we learn more functionality in the system. Silent Auction Pro continues to enhance their product. I would highly recommend Silent Auction Pro!",Recommendations to other buyers: Make sure you order enough credit card readers. If using bid sheets make sure you have a couple of good printers.

Most all contingencies have bee thought through. Can be quickly rolled out quickly. No money need be paid out up front. Excellent customer support.,"Cons: There were a few contingencies which were not covered by the S/W or where the process was not intuitive. Part of our target audience/donor base is from an older demographic, part of which is uncomfortable with mobile phone apps and technology. We needed to develop work arounds to address these donors.","Overall: Great experience with Silent Auction Pro running a Benefit for an Outreach Program for a 200+ Year old Church. Silent Auction pro helped us to move Church fund raising approaches more fully into the 21st Century. Without Silent Auction Pro we could not have organized to stage the auction with the short time frame that we allowed ourselves. Had we organized ourselves to start the planning process earlier we could have been more successful with the ticket sales and fundraising, but in any case we exceeded our expectations.","Recommendations to other buyers: Start the planning process early. Organize and select your volunteers early enough to train volunteers and rehearse the process. However, one we have started using the S/W, repeated uses should become much easier as we move down the learning curve."

We had an event to go to- I made an account and purchased our tickets for the event and was assigned a bidder number for the event. I made a mistake and pressed the accept button 5 times and it charged my card 5 times! I immediately called and emailed customer service explaining my mistake. They took care of the problem right away and refunded the extra 4 charges. I received personal emails regarding the charges and how they were fixing it for me. It was great customer service! I was a bit hesitant about the online bidding process for the event. I've never been to a charity event where we didn't have to stay near the silent auction to keep an eye on our items that we wanted to ensure not getting out bid. I was unsure if it would be easy or difficult. Let me tell you- it was so easy! I logged into the website with the username and password that I set up when purchasing our tickets. My bidder number was automatic. I reviewed the auction items on the list. Walked around only once to choose which items we wanted to bid on. I bid on several items and then I was free to go to our table and enjoy the dinner and social hour without having to stalk the silent auction area! I watched my items- it notified me when I was outbid. I continued to bid on the things we really wanted. After the bidding ended it let me know which items we won and the checkout process was a piece of cake too. Press the button to buy and it charged my credit card on file. It was so simple and we really enjoyed our event. We donated to a great cause and this system made it a lot easier! Thanks so much!,,,,

Add some functionality options for processing invoices.,"Overall: We've been using Silent Auction Pro (SAP) for 6 years now. We moved from using an Excel spreadsheet which became very hard to manage since our donations were increasing. The functionality fit us perfectly along with a price point that we could afford. For each of the 6 years, we always have question that come up and the SAP customer service always responds in a timely fashion. The use of SAP also has minimized if not eliminated the auction customer issues we encountered while using a spreadsheet to manage everything. I would highly recommend using SAP for anyone want to run a silent auction!",Recommendations to other buyers: Great customer service on a personal level. Not the big corporate culture where you have to press 10 digits just to talk to a person.

The instructions in the Help section are very thorough. When I had questions, I was able to reach someone right away, and whomever I spoke with was very helpful. An event agent called me the day before and the day of the event, to help with any last minute issues. Although the front end interface is not fancy, our guests found the site easy to use. Silent Auction Pro offered the best, most economical price structure of all the Auction Software, and I did a lengthy comparison in a spreadsheet of all the auction software out there.

Some guests balked at mobile/online bidding.","Overall: Our experience with Silent Auction Pro represented the first time we had conducted an online/mobile auction.

Our school has had an auction for 17 years. We found the web-based platform to be very flexible and easy to use for multiple volunteers from home or any other place they have access to Internet. Silent Auction Pro was very responsive and able to help us work through many issues. There are many great functionalities that are available with the system if they are purchased.

One issue we noticed was that we frequently have items at our Live auction that are high dollar and are purchased by several bidders who want to split the cost and claim as a tax deduction. The previous system we used had an option on the software known as a ""split bid"". Our data entry person would enter the numbers of the bidders who wanted to split the total cost of an item. These bids would have the same item number and each bidder would have a correct dollar amount of what they paid for the item on their tax letter. We were disappointed that Silent Auction Pro did not have this capability since our old system did. Overall, we like the real-time tracking of all the donations and income. It would be fantastic if there was one area to log expenses.",,,,

It completely steam-lines our auction processes. I've used it for 3 auctions and can't imagine ever planning and executing an auction without it again. (In fact, I refuse to plan a fundraiser if I can't use the software now that I know how valuable it is.) The planning and preparation of an auction is incredibly time consuming and this Silent Auction Pro took the struggle out of the process. We significantly reduced auction check-out time with the stored credit card pre-authorization function. Not only does this help our attendees as they can securely enter their credit card numbers on-line themselves, it also helps our volunteers as we don't have to spend time entering credit card information in order to check them out. In addition, all auction purchases can be very quickly charged even if the winner is not present and each winner immediately receives an invoice via email. If there's a mistake, refunds can also be given very simply. There are so many fantastic features that I can't speak of them all here but will mention another favorite, the Auction Program feature. You can quickly and easily print Auction Programs which include all auction items titles, descriptions and auction numbers with a simple export! Amazing! Thank you Silent Auction Pro! Jim Donnell is also very responsive and helpful if there's ever a question about the product and how it can serve your auction.",,,,

It solves all aspects of planning and executing an auction relative to tracking of contacts/donors/donations. Most importantly for me personally is the level of customer service support. They are truly outstanding in getting back to you with answers to your questions. We had several volunteers who needed additional training on the software.

1950,silent_auction_pro,Great Program and Awesome Service!,Scott B.,Kiwanis Club - Marketing & Promotions,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,2018-09-30,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,9.0,,"Pros: I found this system to be very user-friendly. The few times that I had questions or needed assistance, the Silent Auction Pro team was quick to respond and made things much more simple than I was trying to make it. This was our first time doing an online silent auction and I feel that this was PERFECT for us! I was also very pleased with the ability to post pictures and lengthy descriptions with the items we were auctioning off. The payment process for the auction winners was wonderful! They were able to quickly pay and the reports that the system provided to us truly made delivery and follow up easy for us.","Cons: The only issue that I had was that this system seems to be set up for those who are having ""an event"" along with the silent auction. Sometimes, that made things a little confusing for me as we were only doing the online auction. A couple of little changes could be made for those who do not have events so that there are options for both types.",Overall: Absolutely wonderful!! Our sincerest thanks to the whole Silent Auction Pro team! They made this venture for painless for us. And they were quick to assist and also give helpful suggestions and tips that would make the whole process even easier and better for those bidding on our items! Will definitely be utilizing them again for all our future silent auction needs.,

Keeps history so you don't have to re-input all data from repeat donors. Easy to learn, and excellent demo site for pre-purchase experience as well as allowing your users to play in the demo area to practice before using it at the event.","Cons: Really only one thing....bidder numbers keep incrementing year after year which is needed to retain historical data. (I'm told they are working on a fix!) . Other than that, I can't think of one thing I don't like!!",Overall: Perfect! Being using it for 7 years and wouldn't do an auction without it. Allows you to do total mobile bidding or manual bid sheets. Customer support is very important to me and and his team are the BEST. Crazy good support!! Needed help on auction day which was on a Saturday night and rep. was available and fixed the problem. Updates and advancement in the software happen continuously so they are moving forward! Can't say enough great things about Silent Auction Pro.,
1952,silent_auction_pro,I continue to be amazed at all that Silent Auction Pro can do and how easy it is to use.,Cynthia D.,Gala Committee Auction Chair,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,2017-07-14,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: The program is intuitive. With a little practice, it is easy to find the tools I needed. The support from the Silent Auction Pro was immediate and always helpful. They also initiate follow-up calls to check on how we are doing. I truly enjoyed working with each of them.","Cons: My only disappointment is that we did not move ahead in our selection to Silent Auction Pro earlier in our annual process. We did not have the time to use the program to the fullest extent, You can be certain that we plan to begin now to position ourselves to use the program to its best advantage for our event next year.",Overall: The ability to track our data more easily including donations and donor history. Electronic bidding was loved by many but frustrated some of our older guests and others who were reticent to give their credit card to allow them to bid. These are only minor issues that we will anticipate and prepare ourselves to manage better next year. The benefits far outweighed the challenges.,

We knew we were struggling with check in and check out lines and not giving our guests the best possible experience at the event. I did some research and found Silent Auction Pro. We were able to call and get a demo the next day - we couldn't believe how user friendly the system was and how much it would cut down on the time it took us to manually create packages and create display sheets. I was also excited about how easy it would be to send a thank you to event attendees, bidders and donors the day after the event. I also had access to all sorts of reports following our gala and could quickly generate statistics from the event. This all usually takes me up to a week after the event to pull all the information. We received great feedback on the ease of use - we jumped right in and used the mobile bidding. Guests of all ages could use their smartphone or go to a kiosk in the room to quickly place bids and receive notifications if they had been outbid, leaving them more time to socialize with other guests. Customer service was awesome - we had a question during the event, we called and talked to someone right away who walked us through exactly what we needed to do. Overall we are very happy with the experience and will use Silent Auction Pro for our event again next year!",,,,

I was totally immersed in it, learning every possible feature and application, to ensure that we got the maximum use.","Pros: Silent Auction Pro is an all-inclusive software charity organization events or online auctions for fundraising efforts. It manages contacts, monitors donations, item bundling, integrated credit card processing, and a lot more. The full-featured Silent Auction Pro also supports mobile and online bidding. This will allow organizations to attract more bidders from all around the world and increase their profits. Not only can they raise more money for their charity work but they are also able to spread the word about their efforts and even appeal to more supporters.","Cons: Special characters are not readable in the software for donation title, so I have had to change certain titles once they get loaded into the system as an auction item. The special characters examples(for inch threw off the formatting of the data export to excel). Reporting is good but it would have liked a few more reports or the ability to create ad hoc reports.",,

Silent Auction Pro is a user friendly software and met all of the needs of our event, from acquiring donations to selling event tickets and communicating with guests to the actual auction. The end user product looks professional and our guests commented on its ease of use!","Cons: The most confusing set up was with our raffle items, but the process made sense after talking to customer support. Would like the option to sell and track raffles by bidder and not issuing actual raffle tickets.",,
1956,silent_auction_pro,Greatest Decision I Made Yet!,Brandy R.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2017-01-06,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,"Comments: I have been running the fundraising event for years and after attending a special Gala myself recently, as I guest, I was able to see their silent auction was done digitally. It peeked my interest and I had to find out how to one day add it to my own events. I took the time to follow up afterward to find out the pricing for such a modern system but was shocked to discover they invested close to in moving their silent auction digital. I was upset to learn the cost and thought we would never be able to do such an improvement as the cost was too high for our small organization.

This led me to start researching software that was currently out in the market and I came across Silent Auction Pro. The reviews were amazing and the pricing was UNBELIEVABLY affordable!!! I am very happy to say that as unbelievable as it sounded, we took a chance on the product, and it was the greatest decision I have made for our organization yet!!! Everything turned out splendid, the digital silent auction went off without a hitch and was a HUGE success. The software is very simple, extremely easy to get around, and it even had a few features to save us time and money. The customer service we received from beginning to end was unsurpassed in excellence! They have won us, our guest, and the charity we support over and I will be using them for years to come!!

There are a ton of how to's in the help section, if you can't find what you need in that section, their customer support team is top notch. We will be using this software for years to come.","Cons: Getting to different places within the software is a bit time consuming.

Everything is user friendly. There is the help menu that explains every aspect of the auction. There are even video help pages so you can watch it being done.,"Cons: There really is nothing to not like. The thank you letters are a little difficult, I was told by another staff member, but I've had no problems.","Overall: I don't know what software the previous auction administrator used, but the checkout like was horrendous and it did not seem like everything was as organized as the previous three years we've used Silent Auction Pro. The donations, were more organized and the check out was a breeze.",
1959,silent_auction_pro,The Only Way to Go,Greg D.,Volunteer,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2015-02-21,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"Comments: We just completed our 8th auction with Silent Auction Pro and the first one using the online capability. The feedback from our attendees was very positive. We believe the only way to go now is online and paperless. We have always had outstanding support from SAP. The software lets you perform routine tasks once and automates the rest. Excellent data export capability. It makes the event enjoyable for volunteers and attendees. Between the school and church auctions we have run 8 events with Silent Auction Pro and raised over $383K. We are going to continue to use the software as it seems to get better every year and worth every penny. The software is easy to use and learn. There are huge advantages when next year's event rolls around and everyone knows what to do from the beginning and they can work from home with the web based software.

The only con at the event was not related to the software but cell phone coverage. Customers of a popular cell phone carrier with an Android phone had good service but the same carrier with an iPhone was not good. It would be an idea to use wireless access points that can accommodate a sufficient number of guest accounts or rent/buy a cell phone signal booster/relay if there are any concerns about less than excellent cellphone coverage for all carriers in your area.",,,,
1960,silent_auction_pro,SAP saves time!,Judy S.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2017-03-20,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,10.0,,"Pros: Ability to print spreadsheets to look for errors, reassure ourselves that we have everything. Checkout with SAP we can use credit cards. Ease of preparing for in person bidding, printing of bid sheets is easy. Also like the ability to change minimum bids, bid increments and buy it now values.",Cons: If you group items the spreadsheets can get a little wacky. Easy to fix but you do have to fix it.,"Overall: The best part of SAP is the time it saves for completing your auction and checking everyone out. We use the system to enter all donations and create our paper bid sheets. First we go online only, then we print everything for the final on site bidding. The spreadsheets and lists that are automatically created allow us to double check that everything we received has actually been entered and assigned numbers. It is also so helpful that it can track different accounts within the system. We are raising money for more than one troop and we need to be able to see the final numbers for each troop. SAP does this for us. The check-out is a breeze if you have already entered credit card information when people are assigned their bid numbers.",Recommendations to other buyers: Wasn't hard to learn to use.

From their demonstration of the product prior to our deciding to work with them to the incredible technical support, Silent Auction Pro has everything covered. Any time I called them with a question, it was answered fully and politely. I never felt like I was bugging them or asking silly questions and that's an important aspect to me. The day of service was incredible. We ran into a problem we hadn't thought about prior and they answered immediately and I was able to make my bidder happy again within minutes. The mobile bidding was wonderful; it definitely keeps people engaged and the price going up when everyone gets text message alerts! I feel like I only scratched the surface of everything Silent Auction Pro has to offer. I cannot wait to use them for our event next year and make it even bigger and better. I don't know how the competitor companies get away with charging what they do. Silent Auction Pro does it all for a fraction of the price. You cannot go wrong and you will not be disappointed if you put your trust in Silent Auction Pro. Your event will definitely be a success! We tripled our profits from last year to this year and that's in large part thanks to the cost and effectiveness of Silent Auction Pro.",,,,

I've used the software now to run a first, smaller event and received great reviews both from guests and from staff using it. What I love best above all is the incredible customer service that Silent Auction Pro offers. They really want to make sure you succeed. In the days and weeks leading up to the event, Silent Auction Pro staff contacted me regularly to make sure that my planning was on track and I was comfortable using the software.","Cons: The only feature I am missing is the ability to import data from spreadsheets.

Every time I called with a question, I reached a competent, knowledgable person who was able to help me out quickly and efficiently. Our annual auction is the only fundraiser we do for our MOPS group and it works perfectly for our needs, plus there are even features we didn't get to, but would be beneficial as we become more and more familiar with this product, like using the text or emailing feature to notify past attendees of an upcoming auction, or donation info, or getting the hype up about what will be available.",,,,

I also really liked being able to print bidder number and bidder sheets ahead of time.,"Cons: Having a computer based systems was nice however, we felt there were a few things we didnt like. We found when going from an auction page to auction item the pages didn't talk to each other and wouldn't update. I also didn't like that the bidder sheet wouldn't allow for more than one auction item to be featured. In the past, my group likes to put up every logo that is in the package and show proper representation. We needed to make our own in the end.",,

Having users store credit card info in the system made check out very easy for us as well as our attendees. Having the option of attendees viewing auction items before event helped build excitement.","Cons: Many of our attendees complained that the software was a mobile website and not an app. We wished there were more info in the help section about how to give our users a better experience.

In addition, the videos for how to use the software are very well done and easy to understand!",Cons: There really wasn't anything that we didn't like about this software.,"Overall: Previously we have had a more create-as-we-go-along approach to each dinner auction held. We were looking for greater portability in auction coordinating. Meaning, we want to be able for someone to walk in the door and be able to understand what was done in previous auctions and be able to carry it forward with little to no difficulty.

It took a lot of convincing to go this route, and we didn't go full in with the online bidding, but I hope to next year. We have 30 women all bringing in donation items, selling raffle tickets and event tickets. Silent Auction Pro made it so easy for everyone to enter their own contacts and donations. It eliminated the need for multiple emails and the potential for soliciting the same donor. Silent Auction Pro is very intuitive and had everything we needed, even including a way to do a reverse auction (they call it Fund-a-need)! Jim and Breann were always available if I had a question, and always had a solution to any problem I came across. The customer service was over the top. Our information will be stored so that next year half the work is already done. There is no question of convincing the group- we were all impressed, we had a record fundraiser with very little problems and next year we will be using mobile and online bidding.

This tool helped us to start the silent auction early and therefore make a larger profit for our benefit. The customer service was one of the best I have ever worked with and they got back with answers to questions the same day. There were quite a few different fees included, but if doing a larger silent auction its worth the cost. The ease of use for ticket purchasing and running a silent auction was worth it. It was great that you did not have to hold a checkout for the payments and they were already set up online.

The program was everything I expected it to be and well worth the money. I didn't use the Auction Day option because of poor wifi at the venue, but I will find a way to use it next time. The customer service was absolutely amazing - I received at least 5 phone calls from SAP just to see if I needed help with anything and they even did a one-on-one training class with me for an hour when I first started using the program.

They would stay on the phone and walk us through whatever help we needed from original set-up, to ongoing questions, to the day of the event and then after the event. They called us many times just to check in and see how we were doing. We raised double what we had the previous years and now have all of the data saved for next year. I can't speak more highly about them. I'm now recommending them to anyone that asks.",Recommendations to other buyers: Just that your technical support is the best I have ever encountered anywhere.

No matter your skill level it is easy to maneuver through the system to input information and keep track of your donors. It is a great donor management system and works well for your fundraising event.,"Cons: I wish the photos for the mobile bidding looked a little better. There are guidelines available in help section to help ensure you use best format and size for the images. All and all they look good, but I know this is a feature they are continuing to update and I'm excited for any updates to this. However, our event still went well and mobile bidding was easy for all our bidders to use","Overall: It is a great tool and easy to use donor management system. To get the most out of your experience use your event coaches. Create a list for yourself of all the things you want to do and want to use, and they can help ensure you are using the shortcuts available and tools/features to make your event a success.",

I would highly recommend this software to help make your event run efficiently. The software is easy to use and really saves a lot of time and relieves a tremendous amount of stress that comes along with putting on an event. We did not have this software the previous year for our event and this year's event ran so much more smoothly than last year because of silent auction pro. The software is very affordable and worth every dollar spent. Anytime I had questions, the staff at Silent Auction Pro was easily accessible and more than willing to help.

1984,silent_auction_pro,Silent Auction Pro Software,Heather D.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2017-01-23,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,"Comments: We recently purchased Silent Auction Pro just before our fundraising event. We did so on the recommendation of someone who uses it for very large events. Although we started our event using a different software, next time we will use Silent Auction Pro to manage both the ticket sales, marketing, and the Silent Auction portion of our event.

Some specific features that made it very helpful to us include:

- Detailed tracking of each attendee. This will be crucial to us because we will have attendee information for future events related to our cause.

- Great features for entering donations, and then creating Auction Items by bundling several donations together

- Super streamlined process for entering bid winners, creating final invoices, notifying winners, and accepting final payments.

- Absolutely top notch support. Whenever we called to clarify a procedure we were able to speak to our representative and get specific information. The support team also made sure to walk us through the end of evening processes so that we would be comfortable on what to do.

- Written Help information is excellent as well as the video support

The team was really great, supportive and answered all of my questions. Another ""pro"" was earning extra money, going online really worked!","Cons: I wish the software was a little more intuitive, it was a bit of a learning curve for me. But honestly, I know there is so much going on behind the scenes, a software would have to read my mind for me to really understand it! I also wish we didn't have to get a merchant account. I knew I wouldn't use it and it was a lot of extra steps (and stress) for something that didn't impact my system.","Overall: We've only been hosting an Auction for our preschool for a few years, but wanted to try out the online option. Silent Auction Pro seemed like a good fit for our process so we gave them a try. Our event was more successful than in previous years, we raised 22% more than last year, which was super great.

I have used Silent Auction Pro for 5 years. It is truly the ideal auction software for non-profit and charity auctions. With over 200 items being donated, it becomes challenging to manage these items in Microsoft Excel - but Silent Auction Pro makes it easy to manage it all. The software manages auction donations, tickets, seating arrangements, and acknowledgements. I have used other auction software and this is by far my favorite.

Working directly with the company made the process pretty seamless.,Cons: The real negative for us was having to enter silent auction donations and ticket sales in the same area. We feel that being able to enter these items in two separate areas would be much less confusing and make for better reporting at the end.,Overall: Silent Auction Pro's price cannot be beat and their support was exceptional. They were always available to answer questions and solve any problems. We have used them for 3 events thus far this year and are gearing up for two more in a few months.

Our event went very smoothly!","Cons:

The software wasn't always intuitive, so we ended up calling support a number of times.

After event reports (which categories of donations returned the highest proceeds, accounting, etc.) offered a lot more information than we had anticipated and has proved to be one of the most valuable features for our group.","Cons: We found the table assignments feature was challenging to use. Also it would have been able to separate admission tickets from other types of tickets sold (i.e. raffle tickets) in the ticket reports. The system recommended entering couples as individuals, this also proved to create problems for us when assigning tables and during the check-in/check-out process.","Overall: After vetting a few other products similar to Silent Auction Pro, we opted to use SAP for our 3rd Annual Event. The price of SAP was considerably less than other products and the features comparable. Customer service was top notch! We had relied on spreadsheets for our prior 2 events and SAP saved an enormous amount of staff time before, during, and after the event.",

Both were easily to resolved with Silent Auction Pro (SAP). Another common issue we had was the ability to grab more bids per auction item. We found a major increase in bidding per person with SAP. Along with this tool, we are now able to see what and who donated items as in the past we were not able to track this. Having the ability to now see the percent return on auction items which we never had before.

Once you get your bearings, practicing on their well thought demo group, it is a cinch to use! I would highly recommend new users take the time to familiarize yourself with the program by surfing around the demo group and asking many questions way before your event is well under way and donations start rolling in. By doing this, it will elevate any issues when you are in the thick of event craziness and just don't have the time to call for help. Any questions I had were answered quickly and completely. Tracking winners, auction totals and all donations is super simple and made post event wrap up a breeze. My biggest fear at any of my events is always check out and this program made it so smooth, I almost questioned if I was doing it right. I would highly recommend Silent Auction Pro to a anyone who wants to run a less chaotic event.",,,,

The transition from online to paper was seamless. For any of the online auction items that did not have bids we could simply printed bid sheets and put them into the silent auction. We had several multi winner items such as a Dodgeball Party that were offered in both auctions. It was easy to just print the bid sheets that already recorded the bids captured during the online auction. We also loved the fact that the multiple payments can be processed for an individual bidder and the invoice/receipt clearly captures the payment activity. During the weeks leading up to our event I had multiple questions for the technical support group. I posted my questions to support@silentauctionpro.com and always received a quick and thorough response. I think their support is top notch.

The support staff were extremely helpful and always available to answer questions or review how we were using the tool.",Cons: There wasn't a lot that I didn't like about this software tool.

This was our first year running the auction completely online and the check out process at the end of the night was a breeze!

Because we were in such a tight window from start to finish the admin side of the program seemed a little daunting. there were a ton of different drop down menus to navigate through. the software seemed to work well and like I said before the feedback from the bidders was they liked it and it was easy to use. Recommendation is give your self a couple of weeks to get familiar with the system, also if you can preregister people for the event this works best. We had 1200 people at a concert and trying to register everyone was overwhelming. All in all the program worked as designed and we are discussing how to better use the software for our next event.",,,,

Anyone on my team can look at it at any time and it's always up to date. Which means it is also a networking tool as well.,"Cons: I wish that once my donors logo is uploaded it would follow the donor on all printed materials., including bid sheets. I also would like to be able to export addresses of both the donors and bidders without having to have Microsoft office. In addition just being able to print a list with just addresses.","Overall: Being able to network, print cation, print bid sheets, cross check bidders with how many items they buy, we sent out blasts about items for sale, eventually online ticket sales and sort items",

Since it is cloud-based, all our volunteers can work in the system at the same time and can enter information as it comes in. We use the AuctionDay feature for check-out which has sped up our process tremendously! Also, the pre-populated thank you notes created after the event save a lot of time and man-power.

I will say that it is easy to follow,Overall: Super excellent. Customer service was fantastic and always so professional. When I had a question that I could not find the answer to on line - I would send an email to rep and she would respond so quickly and always answered my questions and always so helpful and professional.

It fit within our budget and majority of users (a lot of which are not tech-savvy!) had a great user experience and enjoyed the mobile bidding. The back-end (admin) functions were a bit tricky for us to learn, but the Pro staff was always there to help answer our question or assist us which cut the learning curve down significantly. In addition, the founder is heavily involved in ensuring each customer is satisfied with the software and is always looking for guidance and feedback on how the software/user-experience can be improved. This was a huge deal to us and why we will be using it a second time b/c we felt heard and important, not just another client.

We typically have around 120 to 140 items in our auction. This is the second year using Silent Auction Pro. My only regret is that we didn't learn about this product earlier. Before ... the checkout process was one gigantic zoo, people were backed up forever, and trying to manually create and add up invoices was awful (and needless to say, we had many disgruntled attendees when it was all over). With Silent Auction Pro, the checkout process has actually become the easiest part of the event now. And, the reporting features the system has, is incredibly easy to use. Plus, having the database prepopulated with names and e-mails from the previous year, made the check-in process move more swiftly than ever.

I've used much higher-priced auction software in the past and found this to have just as many features as any of those. The customer service piece of it was great. There was always someone available to answer questions over the phone. The video tutorials were very helpful in training the day of staff. It took me 5 minutes to get any volunteer into the system and to learn how to perform any of the functions. With any auction, there is time involved and no software can take that aspect away but using this software saves time in the long run by creating a lot of the materials you will need before, during and after your auction.",,,,

We purchased the full system and it was so worth it. It was straightforward to set up the database and auction items. The auction itself ran so smoothly. Everyone was able access the auction through their mobile phones or bidding kiosks at the event. We also had non-attendee bidders, which we've never been able to do before.

The program has been very easy to use, flexible for a variety of special auction types and the customer support is able to handle any issues quickly with just one phone call. In addition over the last four auctions numerous improvements have been added to make the system more user friendly and efficient. This year was the first time we used the online bidding module. This feature allowed us to move all of the smaller silent auction items into the online system. This allows the volunteers and guests more time and energy for the live auction items raising more funds. I strongly suggest using the online system.

We had used a spreadsheet prior to using Silent Auction Pro which was very cumbersome and hard to manage. Silent Auction Pro has vastly simplified our auction and has allowed us to better manage our auction each year. The customer support has been fantastic! Quick and timely responses for all of my questions. Our auction contains over 400+ items with a retail value just over $20,000. There is no way we could run our auction without Silent Auction Pro.

Silent Auction Pro not only made it go like clockwork, we also had the benefit of all of their great customer service, basically 24/7 for all of our questions getting everything set up. Their staff had an answer for every question we had as well as tips for making the whole event go smoothly. It was amazing to log in on the day after our gala and have all of our auction data grouped and organized and a complete database of all of our guests. We're excited for next year and will be adding more of the Silent Auction Pro options to our event, such as ticket sales and preregistration of attendees with their credit card info for even easier check in. I have to say that the one on one customer service we received was exemplary and the main reason that we were so successful this year!",,,,

2173,spektrix,A lot to offer,Karen E.,Patron Services Manager,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-09-28,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,10.0,,"Pros: One of the nicest things about this is having control over our own ticketing, database, fundraising, etc. without the need to go through another party. For us, we were using three different systems that were not compatible--they were antiquated and clumsy. Spektrix is key in bringing everything to one place. The great part about this software is that it is cloud-based. I can access Spektrix from my phone, tablet, computer at home or a coffee shop or, of course, at the workplace. I've placed ticket orders for people while out on the town and worked through patron data from my couch at home.","Cons: There is not necessarily an overarching dislike of Spektrix. The nice element of the software is that the company behind it is always taking client feedback and making changes to better accommodate their needs. A few challenges we have had in the past include the inability to have an easy way to sell general admission series tickets. There is a fixed seating/fixed series option, but you have to find a loophole for GA series. Additionally, we've done outdoor festival ticketing in the past two years--while the cloud-based system is great, it does require you to have access to internet. It would be great to see a version of the software that you can download and temporarily run off-line if you are ticketing in the middle of a closed-down road for a festival with no wifi nearby that is strong enough to power the system. I don't know if it is possible, but something to think about :)","Overall: There is so much that Spektrix has to offer. We chose Spektrix to solve a few problems--getting our database and patron transactions in one place, control over ticket prices and fees that add up when using third party ticket companies and the ability to collect data on patrons which helps us further engage our community. We've been thrilled about our experience with the company so far--they are diligent with customer service and help work through challenges that their clients are facing even when it reaches further than ticketing/fundraising.",
2174,spektrix,"Spektrix is just the ticket at the Delphi Opera House! Actually, it's more!",Anita W.,President,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-10-09,5,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,10.0,,"Pros: Spektrix has robust functionality in all areas, including ticketing, reporting, CRM, membership, and fundraising. The sales interface at the box office is straightforward and volunteers comfortable with computers can be trained quickly. The web interface is customizable if you have a good developer on your team-keeping the customer on our website rather than going off to a ticket vendor was very important to us and Spektrix enables us to achieve this objective.

By offering ticketing services to area not-for-profit organizations and to the school corporation for plays, we are able to offset some of the fixed monthly fees for use of the Spektrix system.","Cons: The administrative end requires significant training time. Adding events is generally straightforward, but there is no way to save instances that are in draft form without having all of the seating, pricing, and price lists all completed beforehand-an autosave feature would be nice!

Downsides include the clunky ticket designer that doesn't include a graphics option. The scanning interface is limited to Saveo equipment which is an expensive option for a small theater.","Overall: I have been a strong supporter of the Spektrix system and have spent hours in communication with other organizations that are evaluating multiple ticketing vendors for their organization's requirements. I believe the company is the best option available for organizations such as ours, even though they may not be the least expensive option on the surface.",
2175,spektrix,A system which really makes a difference.,Matthew C.,Box Office & Events Manager,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,2017-10-24,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Spektrix genuinely makes a difference to day to day running of the box office with its smooth and intuitive interface. It is a very flexible system and I have found the way it can be developed to suit the requirements of the venue very useful. The marketing and fundraising functionality help not only the box office but the wider organisation. The support team has always been very strong and the fact that all updates, training and support come at no extra cost sets it apart from other systems.","Cons: The administrative end requires significant training time. Adding events is generally straightforward, but there is no way to save instances that are in draft form without having all of the seating, pricing, and price lists all completed beforehand-an autosave feature would be nice!

Downsides include the clunky ticket designer that doesn't include a graphics option.

I also love the custom reports and the attentiveness of the support staff.,Cons: I wish there was a way for patrons to move their tickets to different nights online without having to call the box office. Oh also I wish when looking at a patrons history that the orders tab had the names of the show and donation channel like the tickets and donation tabs do. Just looking at the order number is not particularly helpful to me (but maybe others love it?),"Overall: It is the best ticket and fundraising system I have used, the functionality of program and the easy way it displays data is great. the flow to sell a ticket is simple and the reports are fantastic.",

Prior to Spektix, a lot of work was done manually. Due to this ever evolving system, more processes can be streamlined and the full capacity of the system can be achieved and enabling the customer to get the best possible experience when contacting the box office and purchasing tickets. We are seeing more and more customers engaging with the box office through our website. The marketing interface within spektrix is very dynamic from the segmentation of our customer database to reporting back in a visual and easily read format e.g. a breakdown in customer behaviour over the past 6 months broken down by postcode allows our marketing department to strategically target groups of our current customers as well as the audience we have yet to reach. Understanding our audience more has become easier with the use of such a powerful tool. These types of reports can be used to influence programming decisions.","Pros: Exceptional customer service and regular improvements/upgrades, free training and tips/tricks.

But that is also the same complaint our patrons have about us! We are only staffed at the Box Office on Wednesday and Friday afternoons, however, with most of our patrons with the internet they are able to conduct business with us either on our website or via e-mail.","Overall: After reviewing and considering about 6 different ticketing programs, we decided that Tick It offered the most value and could provide us with any reports we might want. We were looking for a system that we could use just in the house and then at a later time put on-line. Since we were able to keep the program and data on our own computers we were able to access data at any time and create queries to get info in a useful format for us. Tech Support is great they have helped solve any problems in a quick and efficient manner. The only thing that is a little inconvenient is the time difference between Michigan and California. But we have never had a ""crisis"" that kept us from operating because of this. We are able to record just about anything we want to track in each customer profile.

We are able to issue gift certificates, flex passes, coupons, season tickets, and reports for our patrons listing their donations. We are able to train volunteers to use the ticketing system very quickly. NCSoftware is constantly improving the programs adding features - even some at our suggestion. When we expanded and put our ticketing online, NCSoftware was available to answer all our question in getting it set up on our own server. Although Chautauqua Playhouse is probably one of NCSoftware's smallest venues they assist us with any problems or changes that we come up with. We are a venue with 96 seats, but we have many of the same needs that a much larger venue would benefit from. We are able services for our patrons that we were not able to do before, like ticket exchanges completed over the phone, patrons don't have to worry about turning in their old tickets to get their new ticket. The system cancels the ticket number of the exchanged ticket and issues a new ticket which is printed in our office as well as emailed to the patron One of the new features added was a reminder email is sent to each patron reminding them the show they are scheduled for, it is sent one or two weeks before the date and then again on the date of the performance, our patrons really appreciate this feature. I would recommend this program for any venue looking for a new system, or upgrading from another provider.",Recommendations to other buyers: We also use this software at our snack bar to facilitate inventory control and POS terminal. Training for the volunteers who staff our snack bar has been very easy - although some wish we would go back to the cigar box for collecting money!

Oveit covers all the management needs that an event organizer has, as you can easily set up badges for the event, and have a complete and real-time access management. Another useful element is the embed function, which enables the event organizer to sell tickets directly from his website. This is very cost effective as a 3rd party ticket seller can be avoided. And one last thing... it's very easy to use. Big plus on that!","Cons: There are so many functions that sometimes you can mix them up, but any organizer can live with that con when you look at the many pros that Oveit has to offer.","Overall: I've used Oveit platform for the charity events organized for HOSPICE Casa Sperantei.

Also, by collecting data from the people that purchased tickets, we were able to keep in contact with everyone, even after the event has ended.

For a charity that needs cost efficiency, Oveit was a perfect solution. The user experience for an organizer is great and it takes around 5 minutes to set up the event and get it going. Also, with just a couple of clicks to manage the whole event, manpower is reduced to minimum and because of Oveit, one man can do the job of many.

You can create an event very easily, share it across multiple platforms, there's a direct link to your Facebook business events page from Eventbrite. Making it super easy to get the word out.","Cons: So, some of the requested features; we would like to see more customization in the actual Eventbrite page itself and as well the emails that are sent out to your invitees. So at the moment, I think there's only two templates and you can't really do much to change the look and feel, or the text within it, so it would be great to be able to customize those features a little bit.","Overall: It's good for anybody that's organizing an event obviously, the nice thing about Eventbrite is that it's free to use long as you're not charging for the event. There is a fee if you are charging for the event so the fees are 2.5% plus 99 cents transaction fee. So that's a service fee to Eventbrite for using their platform. Again, this is only if you're charging for the ticket, and then if there's a credit card use, then the credit card fee is 3.5% which is quite high, but when you factor in the time to chase attendees for invoice payments it's kind of a no brainer",
2247,eventbrite,State of the Art Event management,Janosch F.,Human Resources Consultant,"Internet, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-11-24,5,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,,"Pros: I used Eventbrite a couple of times when booking events for myself or colleagues. It was simple, easy, had the information I was looking for where I expected it to be and all (comprehensive) steps that led me through researching the event (MTP Hamburg) to choosing what I specifically wanted to finalizing booking completely without any hassle. A while later I had to organize an Event myself and remembered my positive experience as a user, which I wanted to provide to attendees of my event as well. It was then, that I realized how much this has to do with the way you setup an event from inside Eventbrite. There is a verry good guide for setting up events and a step by step tour for beginners. There also are recommendations about what to do when and what information might be expected by potential attendees. I liked the basic support which was included as a beginner. Also, there are areas where Eventbrite clearly draws a line regarding its functionalities and forwards you to connected third party services (as for example if you want super fancy badges or have more esoteric data mining procedures in mind regarding your attendees data). As a newbie to event management AND Eventbrite in particular I was also happy about the broad spectrum of FAQ and help videos. I was very happy to be supplied with a solution that provided me with high quality, easy to use features and was free to use for my non-profit event on top of it.",Cons: Speaking of FAQ and learning how to use Eventbrite it is true that there is a lot of material available online. Sadly there is also light and shadow to this. Some of the explanations I found online were clearly dated and others did either not cover the specifics of the topic I needed (recommendation / invitation based multi stepp application requests) or referred to things which had been changed in the past. Also the Options for the design and look of the Event Homepage were limited. These aren't necessarily bad things only. BEing forced to stay with a simple (but still beautiful) Layout as well as required to go with a simpler application process then I imagined in the end turned out to be good as it simplified things and allowed me to concentrate on matters more central to the event I was planning. It just needed some letting go first and willingness to do it differently than I first had imagined.,"Overall: The event I attended which was managed via Eventbrite hat serval hundred attendees. From a visitors perspective anything worked flawlessly and smooth. The event I set up was a lot smaller but also worked out great from an organizers point of view. I am confident Eventbrite played a central role to this as it streamlined the organisation and the preparation as well as positively supported the execution of the events. Eventbrite is a modern, fast and anticipating web application that is easy to use and works for teams colaborating in organizing small and obviously medium to large sized events. It also funnels some of your more exotic ideas about how your event should work down a reasonable lane, which is healthy, es pecially for newcomers and the less experienced. I simply can recommend Eventbrite and will use it again for our followup event(s) in 2019.",
2248,eventbrite,Solid Event Hosting Option With a Few Quirks,Marc H.,Director of Marketing,"Marketing and Advertising, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: GetApp,2016-01-26,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,8.0,"Comments: With a large number of ""event applications"" out there, Eventbrite has found its way to the top of that list thanks mostly to their easy to use interface and well thought out back-end that not only covers all of an event host's bases but also integrates with other areas of their marketing. Free to anyone who isn't requiring payment for tickets, Eventbrite makes it easy to quickly put together a good looking registration page fast, without the hassle of payment or subscriptions. The paid feature for anyone requiring ticket fees is a little more rigid in how the user can collect it's money which can make it a little tougher to work with depending on how badly you need the revenue from your ticket sales. The payment processing fees are still reasonable, though.","Pros: -Powerful system that provides a large number of great features (creating, promoting, tracking, checking-in, analyzing) for free -Event page creation is quick and easy. If you want something simple, you can be done in minutes. If you want to customize different areas of the design and registration process, you have that ability as well. -Integrations with outside marketing platforms like HubSpot and MailChimp allow the user to connect their other marketing platforms together to create the most powerful event marketing toolset you could ask for. -Relatively good analytics and reporting sections gives you solid insight into how successful your event was and where you can improve moving forward. -The mobile application (Neon) for event hosts makes checking in attendants a breeze by either scanning the printed tickets Eventbrite provides or just finding their name and swiping your finger across it! -Customer support is relatively attentive (I've averaged around 3-5 minutes on hold before speaking to a representative via phone) and the knowledge base they've set up on their website it pretty helpful when it comes to answering some of your intermediate-level questions around customization and platform functionality.","Cons: -The paid feature is a little rigid when it comes to payout structure compared to other options. You normally can't receive payout for your ticket revenue until your event ends, making it a tough option for those looking to promote an event months in advance who need the revenue now. Definitely something to consider. They provide early payout, but depending on how much revenue you're expecting to generate, that may not even be a viable option. -Customizing your registration page with your brand's colors, logos and images can be difficult and require some coding skills. You also won't be able to get rid of the Eventbrite branding so anyone looking for total design control may not like this option.",,
2249,eventbrite,A solid simple event registration platform,Verified Reviewer,Director of Marketing,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: GetApp,2018-09-11,4,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,9.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is fairly simple to use and has most the features you would want laid out so you can build an event registration form in steps. Once you set up your account(s) if you are accepting payments, it is straightforward to duplicate events to make new ones as long as they require similar details. There are custom fields you can create with logic behind them so different users may have different options depending on the access you choose for them. There are also ways to create discount codes or hidden fields with different levels of access. This is very useful when you have tired pricing at events and variable discounts to various groups.","Cons: A lot of the settings are in places that don't make much sense and you have to go to completely different sections of the admin section to find settings that you would think are closely related to each other. Some of the features are on by default and you might never notice them until after your event registration has launched. Even though most the settings are easy to change, you basically have to go over every tab, page and setting to be sure they are all correct before you launch your campaign. When you use the custom data fields and discount features, it isn't immediately clear how it all works and again, you need to go to a couple different pages to get them set up properly so it takes some trial and error.","Overall: This is a great solution for simple, straightforward events without too many options. Once you get a lot of different sessions or tracks and registration types, it either can't accommodate or becomes very complicated to manage. Like other tools of this nature, there is a bit of a generic feel to it but that is the compromise for a widely accepted overall, plug and play software. It is effective but there are other solutions that are similar or easier to use and offer more customization options. It is highly likely that we will replace this software with something else in the near future.",
2250,eventbrite,"Great functionality, amazing when listing free events, fees are a bit expensive for paid events",Verified Reviewer,Director of Marketing,"Professional Training & Coaching, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: GetApp,2018-10-29,5,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,8.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite has lots of functionality that you will need when organising and managing an event. It is very easy to use, plus it can integrate with other apps such as Mailchimp which comes in handy when broadcasting an event and Surveymonkey which comes in handy to send out feedback forms post an event. The back office functionality is great too -- you can email invitations directly without using Mailchimp if you wanted to. For users, it's easy and simple to register, plus Eventbrite offers a secure online payment option which is hassle free for both organiser and attendee.","Cons: 2 things that I like the least about Eventbrite are: 1) Non-existent customer service. One of the reasons why I used Picatic (which they have now bought!) was due to their great customer service. You can chat with a real person who can help you with some of the questions which are not answered in their FAQs. 2) They're great if you have a free event, but if you have a paid event, their transaction fees are one of the highest in the market.","Overall: I organise a lot of professional networking events, some are free and some are paid for. Eventbrite offers me all the functionality I need to organise my event. I used Picatic until Eventbrite recently acquired Picatic. However, customer support from Eventbrite is very difficult, if not existent. So if you have a question not answered by the standard FAQ, such as, ""Since Eventbrite acquired Picatic, how I can access my previous/ currently live events""?, the only way I could find customer support was by tweeting Eventbrite. So, Eventbrite is great if you can self-service and publish free events, but once you have quirky questions, be prepared that it will be difficult to establish contact to a human person who can answer.",
2251,eventbrite,Eventbrite makes life easier!,Simone F.,"Media, Development and Marketing Consultant","Philanthropy, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,2017-11-16,4,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Easy to use. You can have your event ticketing up and running in minutes. I have been using Eventbrite for ticketing for about five years. It has helped make event management so much easier. I used it for school admissions and event purposes, for nonprofit fundraising events where tickets were complimentary, etc. It is easy to specify the exact questions for my guests, gathering data on them that helps me in other areas. Easy integration into websites and emails. I have recommended Eventbrite to so dozens of businesses, organizations and individuals. Easy to use product and with all that I often have going on, it's nice to know I can depend on Eventbrite to quickly make a difference.","Cons: You can search for a registration based on a registrant's name. However, you cannot print a report by Registrant's last name. Not being able to print a registration report by the name of the registrant is the only reason I gave this product four stars instead of five stars. Help screens are good. The help response I received was very clear and easy to follow. It would be nice to have a live person to do a chat box with or talk to but so far, all of my questions have been addressed either in the Help screens or when contacting support.",,
2252,eventbrite,Free platform for nonprofits to utilize,Abigail D.,Digital Marketing Specialist,51-200 employees,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-01-31,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,,"Pros: I work at a nonprofit with a small marketing staff. Before using Eventbrite, we were building our events on our website which looked awful and dull. It would take a lot of time for not much reward. With Eventbrite, I can create a basic event in a matter of a few minutes. I can make it private or public to be shared with the Eventbrite community. Best of all, most of our events are free to enter, which means it's free to post them on Eventbrite. It's easy to check attendees in at the door, download reports, and communicate last-minute messages with registrants. Eventbrite is a great tool more companies should take advantage of.","Cons: In some instances, we've held events that require many conditional questions to be completed during registration. Unfortunately, Eventbrite doesn't allow the function of complex, conditional questions, which can really slow down the registration process. On the backend, the menu names aren't the most intuitive. There are certain functions that are difficult to find, such as where to cancel an order, but after expanding each sidebar menu, you can usually find which what you need. My biggest pet peeve with Eventbrite is that if you create an event that takes place more then five weeks away, ticket sales will automatically be set to end in five weeks from that date, regardless of when your event takes place. There have been many times when I've forgotten to change this default date and received complaints of ticket sales being closed weeks prior to an event. I wish Eventbrite would make the default date the date of the event.","Overall: Eventbrite is free for free events, easy to set up and looks professional.",

My preference is Eventbrite. In today's society where people are so busy managing their own lives, its hard bring people together. From a moments notice, to 2-3 weeks in advance, using Eventbrite can make sure your event is anything but successful. Eventbrite offers tools to assure that you can keep up with the logical changes while you are on the go. It also makes it easier for invitees to respond while they are on the go. Its a win win with Eventbrite. It cost effective (no more purchasing expensive invitations and costly postage) and convenient.","Cons: Eventbrite needs to implement a 911 response team approach for customer service. Hit it, respond to it, solve it! Also, so many people are use the service now, I am unaware if it has safe guards against crashing and; if it does... what happens to my information? I do think that due to the high percentage of users at any given time, the system slows down considerably. This can be frustrating when trying to pay for an event or responding to an RSVP. The goal is stay focused on the goal. To assist users in planning and executing hassle, stressfree events.","Overall: My overall experience with Eventbrite has been great! I have read some unfavorable reviews but, that has not changed my mind. I have utilized Eventbrite for internal company events, planning external other social events and purchasing tickets to events.

It doesn't show you only the nearest events but within the country that makes use flexible to register and attend them based on our choice.

I have attended various events listed by Microsoft, Google and others that regularly publish them for free to attend tech conferences and stuffs.

Apart from this, it provides and interface where you can register for events, download tickets, receive notifications, manage your user profiles, filter events based on different categories or pricing, and much more.","Cons: Certain sections(common categories) keep repeating on the homepage of the application which could be avoided, although not sure if they wish to keep users engaged to click on them or for easy access.

Could improve the user experience to some extent!!",Overall: Must watch application if you love staying up to date with events across the country..,

If you know what you like and you choose your interests accordingly, the recommendations are always spot on. It's hard not to find something that would interest you and there are always lots of free events. I had to download the app before I moved to Glasgow because I bought a conference ticket through Eventbrite, but then I started to tinker with it out of curiosity and it quickly became a very useful tool. I was new in the city and it quickly exposed me to a lot of stuff I wouldn't have known about otherwise, I even managed to sneak into an Industry Day type event only older students were supposed to know about (and it was great, by the way).",,,,

I'd like more (easier) customization options for the novice, but I know I cannot have everything. Some of that may be me as I worked with Apple quite a bit and their Training and documentation my have me biased. They have a bite-sized Micro-learning modules for just about everything! We've used at least three others and this is leaps & bounds better than those!","Pros: OK 1) Easy-to-use Interface 2) Outstanding Central Hub for an Event 3) Helped us to Sell Tickets and Take Registrations - made it a lot easier to do and explain ""how to do"" for others 4) Whether at my desk or mobile at-the-event I can see and access everything! 5) User-Experience continually comes in at well-above 95% - Better than anything we've ever used! 6) Eventbrite's honesty because they tell what it CAN DO and then they help you to figure out (using a 3rd Party) to get what you want ! I am not going to go on and on, but I guess I just did! Lots to Eventbrite!","Cons: I'd like to get payout/ticket rev before the event ends, but I suppose it could be us. Also, I am not savvy as I should be to change/update colors/graphics/look-and-feel, so for me it was a lot of launch campaign, but forgot____... Or did not clearly know how to ____. I did access their online tools/FAQs and other training, it was just OK, not stellar. However though, I deal a lot with outstanding companies (Apple) that provide bite-size micro-learning modules for just about everything, so maybe it's just my bias.",,

I love it that it allows you to add any tickets purchased through the software to your Apple wallet, and I also appreciate that it keeps an archive of all the past tickets that you've used through them; for those like me who enjoy keeping their physical tickets as a memento of sorts, this app does it for your digital tickets automatically. All of my transactions with Eventbrite feel safe and secure.","Cons: One time I purchased tickets for a concert, but ended up missing it due to something unforeseen coming up. This was the only event that the app did NOT keep a record of - the tickets have disappeared from my past archive. I would like to see this tweaked where the app saves not only the tickets used, but also those unused.","Overall: As a huge live music fan, Eventbrite has been a great way for me to find and organize my live music itinerary. They are my go-to option for discovering local music events, and the ease with which you can purchase tickets and use them in other apps (such as Apple wallet) has really made the concert going experience easier for me. I appreciate the smooth functionality of the app, and its suggestions about events I would enjoy based on those I have previously attended. Highly recommended.",

I have used it to create events, to purchase tickets or RSVP to events and frequently, to search for events. To create an event page, Eventbrite makes it as easy as possible for you. From there, you have easy access to who is and isn't attending, and also receive a guestlist for your event which you can use for check-in. From personal experience on the user side, I love that once you've RSVPed, you get a clear confirmation email that allows you to easily 'add' the event to your calendar of choice (or you can do this from the Eventbrite page right after you've RSVPed), and Eventbrite plugs in all the relevant information into your calendar. This always saves me so much time and usually encourages me to attend the event. I imagine that the participants signing up for events I have created in the past have also enjoyed this feature.","Cons: There is not a lot of customization available. You don't get to control the font/size or other design-related aspects of the event page so the event information and photo are all presented in the same way for each event. I have, in the past, generally used Eventbrite in combination with other softwares, e.g. a FB event page (that links to the Eventbrite for RSVPs).",,

It's super easy to set up, integrates with Facebook, has its own email feature (or connects with MailChimp, etc.) You can create coupon codes, password-protected events, free events, etc. There's an app to help with check-in or on-site purpose. It's really the best all-in-one ticketing software.","Cons: If you're running a super specialized event or event series, this may not be the best option for you. For example, we run a Theatre Festival with multiple performances a night for one week. We used Eventbrite for the first year, but have since switched to a specific theatre ticketing platform. Eventbrite is great for general use but may not fit every planner's need.","Overall: I couldn't do my job without Eventbrite. The easiest way to sell tickets to your events, fundraisers, galas, etc.",

And good for reserved seating.,"Cons: (1) Customer service. So far it has been almost impossible to get a hold of them.

(2) Reserved seating does not allow customers to select their own seats AND refuse them from leaving an empty seat. Hale Center Theater allows you to do both. You can see more at https://hct.org/online/. I'd love to see Eventbrite incorporate this feature. Maybe they do but I haven't been able to get a hold of anyone and started reaching out on Tuesday. It's Friday.

(3) Comped Tix: Can't purchase comped tix and non-comped tix at the same time. Must go back into the system to buy more tix.",Overall: I sent an email on Tuesday and haven't heard back from Eventbrite. I have spent hours on their blogs and I still have several missing questions. I called there on-boarding program and you can only leave a voicemail. I'll update if I hear back from them in the 24 hours they promise.,

It allows you to book events, invite a few or a mass of people via spreadsheet or other import functionality and schedule the timing of when the invites will go out. Furthermore, it can do follow up reminders and keeps track of who opened the invitation, the attendance, and what type of ticket was purchased. Most importantly, it allows you to offer many types of attendance tickets, including a virtual attendance option if you're livestreaming. This is crucial if you're trying to get an accurate headcount of people who will be physically in attendance at your event.","Cons: The multi user interface gets a bit tricky during set up. If you want multiple individuals managing your events, the set up is initially a bit taxing but once its up and working, there isn't an issue. There should just be a click and go functionality for assigning managers and users.",,

It perfectly eliminates the need to share invitation cards to closed associates ; as I can simply send a mass,one-click email invite to everyone. Eventbrite also allow recipients of the event invite to either print out the invite or download it as a .pdf file on their smartphone.

More importantly, this platform enable me check-in attendees by using the Eventbrite Organizer mobile app. to scan QR codes on event tickets.","Cons: Eventbrite becomes very costly when you offer paid tickets on the platform. Apart from the initial charge,which allow you create the event on the platform, there is a ten percent charge on the total amount of tickets sold via the website.",,

Eventbrite doesnt charge for free/small events! Everything is easy for the basic user to do. There are a number of customization features you can apply and it even integrates with website builders pretty easily. I have been on both ends using Eventbrite, both as an organizer putting it together, and an end user, making a purchase or attending an event via Eventbrite and the interface is simple on both sides. There is also an app to use on your phones.","Cons: There are a number of customization features, but colors aren't one of them but this is pretty minimal as an issue. I just want to get the even up and running and promote it to allow for people to register and all of that works with Eventbrite. It has taken off and you really can't go far without seeing it being used.",Overall: I have been happy with Eventbrite. This is a solid event hosting/creation program with a great interface and userability. Managing events/conferences etc can be tedious and time consuming and this will help take a lot of the legwork off your plate.,

Eventbrite allows the users to quickly create and manage events. In EventBrite, One can easily create the events and circulate across the community, do promotions, get the RSVPs, sell the tickets, print tickets and many other features. In Eventbrite, one can easily design the events and share it across asking the recipients to show interest and buy the tickets if its require payments. The Payment gateway within Eventbrite allows user to pay in multiple ways. The Admins who create the events can easily manage within Eventbrite, Admins can export the data, look at the summary in the dashboard, get details as per the ticket type etc. Eventbrite is easy to use with the mobile App, one can provide the options to enter discount codes, perform email marketing, and other paid advertising integrations.","Cons: Eventbrite has its own disadvantages. Its not fully Free for users. Only if the events are Free then the events can be setup Free of Cost. If there is any ticket cost for the event then one has to go for the Eventbrite Paid solution options, It does allow to pass the Eventbrite payment to pass on the attendees but overall it does involve a cost and not fully Free for the event organizers. It does not has good registrant tracking options. Eventbrite is recommended if the event is comparatively on a small scale and specific community focused.",,

Users of Eventbrite may not necessarily be looking for ""library programs"" but are merely perusing local events and they come across us alongside even paid types of activities, concerts, etc. People who might never see us because they aren't regular library users will come to know us because we were billed alongside more widely know groups.",Cons: As with any new tool there is a learning curve but once we figured out the ins and outs of copying and pasting links to Eventbrite into our in house calendar it couldn't be simpler.,"Overall: Eventbrite has been extremely helpful for our library. We cannot only advertise through them but also limit the group size by being able to offer online tickets. This has been amazing in helping us keep events more streamline and manageable. In addition, when tickets ""run out"", we are able to see the need to offer perhaps other slots of an event or programs of a similar nature in the future.",

It makes it very easy to sign-up for an account and create events. Eventbrite eliminates the need for companies to build and manage their own in-house event management solution. On the part of consumer users , I use Eventbrite to find interesting events happening around my location ; thus I can say Eventbrite makes my social life more fun.","Cons: We have had occasions where we receive information about a person interested in our event and it turns out they submitted a wrong email address. In this situation , it would had been nice to be able to collect phone numbers of people registering for events.",,

Many customers don't have this figured out but luckily there's always also an attachment to the confirmation email which also has the QR code we need, or we can pull up like a will call list on our scanner's app or print it out on paper - lots of ways to make it work makes that process pretty smooth. I love the functionality integrating with Facebook, where a) you can sell tickets directly from a FB event, like not even navigating away from that FB page for the sale, and also b) it's very easy to create a fb event from the admin backend of an event's ticket page.","Cons: It seems like with the recent acquisition of Ticketfly, many reps who came over from there weren't really trained on the differences with this new service, and aren't much more helpful than just clicking around and figuring it out on your own.",Overall: I'm a house manager at two different small performance venues that have switched to Eventbrite from other services within the last couple of years. In some ways the adjustment has been tough but overall we're pretty happy.,

It's so easy to get your event up and running with minimal steps. They also make it easy to customize your event to stand out. We use Eventbrite for all our events. We recently had an event get postponed two hours before the event because of a sudden, unexpected snow storm. It became a complicated situation to resolve, but eventbrite quickly stepped in to help us get it sorted for the rescheduled date. Their team truly went above and beyond",Cons: That I can't add a sub user that already has account to my event.

It gives me a full-featured registration program for my non-profit's events so I can track flow of communication, know who signed up and track event participation across the year. We only pay fees for the events that have an associated cost for attendance.","Cons: The software is so robust, there is a significant learning curve and it can be easy to miss one of the fields for communication that goes to attendees. Recently, there was a poorly worded addition to the Terms of Service that caused a bit of a flareup....claiming IP rights to things way out of line!....but management rolled that back pretty quickly. (If staff have a desire to write ToS that is out of line, will it happen again after this flareup settles down?? Be vigilant...)","Overall: Free registration tracking program with little or not cost. Historic tracking of member engagement with our events. Ability to do credit card processing for paid events, while still getting free access for events with no ticket costs.",

The feature I love the most from Eventbrite is that it provides the option to create access codes in order for our attendees to redeem our previous offers or rates. We've had other scenarios where they purchased a registration but ask for the previous rate so we had to refund, and it't very easy to locate their registration and proceed with the partial refund. This makes my job lot faster!","Recommendations to other buyers: Add the option to keep track who was the original attendee, even after editing the attendee information and transferring to a new person"

I love that Eventbrite can be molded to match a lot of the events I'm doing. Some are free events where I need to collect user information, others are paid events where I have to collect dietary information for meals, and other events could just be a place for me to collect payment for a collective order. No matter the event, I've found a way to use Eventbrite and save myself so much time! I use to use internal spreadsheets for everything, and accept mailed payments. Thanks to Eventbrite, I can share a link and move on to the next task on my list!","Cons: Eventbrite can do so much, it's really irreplaceable. I think something that could take Eventbrite to the next level is a seating arrangement function. I think they have the ability to allow buyers to select their seats, but I have some events where I assign seating. It'd be great to take the registration list and assign them a seat, all on Eventbrite.",,

They always are quick to solve any issues I may have. It is a breeze to set up events, even multiple date events. I love how the back end makes it easy to see how many tickets were sold, how much net/gross, and linked pixels. All our team can use it and understand how to make changes which says a lot because we have quite a few that wouldn't consider themselves tech savvy.","Cons: There are actions that I wish I could complete like hiding certain dates that are linked to other dates.

As industries, and institutions have continued to adopt it, and global penetration expands it's reach, the ability to identify events based on topical relevance anywhere can facilitate the orchestration of communities and help them grow. It not only helps get the word out, but it increases effectiveness of collaborations across institutional silos or barriers to facilitate learning, and participation. The ability to monetize on a tiered basis (even offering free access), manage levels of participation and customize, share content, and find similar events, all contribute to the value and enable participants to become more involved to achieve shared goals.",Cons: The ability to create microsites for events that could be linked to a sponsors website where dynamic and interactive content could be updated may enhance future versions.,,

Creating an event is as simple as creating a social media post, you can even organize free local events around your area, manage ticketing , reserved seating among others. The Interface is very straightforward and supply many options in how to create or search for an event.",Cons: Getting a hold of Customer support is nearly to impossible. This is the only downside I can really think of when speaking of Eventbrite.,"Overall: Eventbrite has helped me not only by facilitating event creation, but also by helping me find events around me. I think that even if you do not need to create an event, you should totally try it out if you are the kind of person always looking to do something new and exciting.",

- visibility to consumers via their consumer facing product

- flexibility in payment for customers

- how quickly you can get an event up and running

- lots of plugins for your site/mobile/affiliates","Cons: - No cross selling opportunities (would love to sell tickets for additional attractions when they buy admission)

- Doesn't allow for complicated packages (at least at our tier)

- to upgrade costs more than we've ever spent on ticketing system and requires a pretty solid contract

- More complicated packaging of tickets -- ie: ticket to enter, plus beer token, plus parking, plus etc. etc. with the ability to add money on demand",Overall: The company has clearly focused on destroying the eco system that Ticketmaster had cornered. They've done it. The platform they provide is great and I hope to see them develop even more modules for event planners to use and grow their event. I DO wish that they would offer some of the abilities that their RFID products have into eTickets as well and that they would offer that functionality at my current tier.,

This application allows you to create both free and paid-events. If you are enrolled in a subscription for a paid-event, you can choose to opt-out at any time with no additional fees attached, etc. Because of the increase in visibility, this application provides, we have received more registrants for our events through organic traffic (more than often our registrants come from direct traffic or referrals). Eventbrite also captures various analytics on your events (that can be viewed within the applications dashboard or easily exported) that help you analyze and understand your audience, where your traffic is coming from, and keep track of sales, etc. One of its best features is the availability to access details and analytics on your event at any time, from any advice, so you can save on time and focus on other important matters.","Cons: The free version does not provide you with the option to ask registrants questions when they are in the process of purchasing their tickets. The ability to ask questions was beneficial to our company because it helped us gage our registrants' level of experience and/or areas of interest, to better understand how to engage with them during events, etc.",,

It's easy to create events and share them across multiple platforms.","Cons: The fees start to add up if you are charging for the event and paying to use Eventbrite. The credit card fee of 3.5% seems particularly high to me. Also, the emails and event pages are not very customizable. I think there are only a couple email templates, so some variety there would be nice.",Overall: My organization hosts events all over the world and Eventbrite has been a life saver. It helps us both get the word out and track trends over time.,

Every event has its purpose or goal and the right performer, speaker, audience and tools will make it a successful one. You can find performers, magicians, speakers, entertainer where profile, reviews are available. Book them easily with the messaging or communication feature of Event Brite. Event brite also notifies you through email on every inquiry or reply you get. You can not find any application or software that would match How Event Brite is performing and all members are satisfied and happy with it.","Cons: I am satisfied with its performance, features and events all over the world can be accessed. I just hope that Eventbrite can think of exploring more features taking each event to the next level. Maybe someday it would have this feature where regardless of what location or country you are, you can also have the feature of making international talents perform in a different country.

The pricing structure makes more sense for large high ticket-price events than small ones, making it difficult to justify as a long term solution for growing monthly events.",,
2281,eventbrite,Eventbrite is great for planning events,Kathleen D.,worship pastor,"Religious Institutions, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2019-08-01,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,7.0,,"Pros: I have used Eventbrite to plan 8 events for 500+ people at each event. It really is very nice to use when you need your guests to fill out specific fields in order to make your event successful. We hosted an event where we needed 800 guests to be seated at 90 specific tables. Eventbrite did very much help us to be able to sell tickets to a broader audience and organize them as best we could. The Facebook integration is very helpful to sell tickets through our Facebook event, and the check-in through the app at the event from our iPad helped us to get 800 people through the door much faster!",Cons: It is getting increasingly expensive. I feel like the cost is becoming prohibitive to it being beneficial.,,
2282,eventbrite,"Good, but could be better for large-scale events",Liam W.,Digital Marketing,"Events Services, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-11-20,4,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,8.0,,Pros: The back office system is great. I especially like how you can quickly pull code to embed ticket sales in different ways onto your website. The reoprting is excellent and it's great for problem solving when a buyer contacts you with a question about their order.,"Cons: Having used Eventbrite for a large-scale event and being on their top-tier product, I'd like a dedicated account manager to be able to call rather than having to use the generic contact us.",Overall: Having used several ticketing services for consumer events Eventbrite is by far the best.,
2283,eventbrite,Probably the best system for event management,Verified Reviewer,Digital Marketing,"Political Organization, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,2019-07-17,5,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,8.0,,"Pros: The features that are offered are great. The possibility to offer the tickets in different languages and the extra tools that come with making the whole system one of the best ticket management out there. Also worth mentioning that you can alway use this software, with all its features for free!",Cons: There are some features that are falling a bit behind in terms of keeping up with the ease of use and feel of modern websites. It is something that it can be updated any time so definitely not a major turn off.,Overall: We started using this software since 2010 with our free events. The fact that they would let you use the features for free it's just amazing. We knew that when we started charging we just had to stay with Evenbrite and we have stayed with them for all these 9 years. Not once we switched or even tried another service because it is just a very easy to use and friendly system.,

In my role at a microbrewery, we use Eventbrite for ticketed special events like Beer Flow Yoga classes, or brewery tours.","Cons: Sometimes it's hard to find certain settings, particularly the ticket sales date range. I've accidentally published events that displayed ""sales ended"" for tickets, because the date had changed, and there's a separate field for the timeframe your tickets will be available for purchase. You'd think this would automatically update when you change the event date, but nope.",,

They do take a cut of the check, but you can pass those fees on to the buyers. If you choose to absorb the online fees, then it does cost some money. I also like the ease of use. It's very easy to move through the process and set up an event without many hiccups or training.","Cons: I least like the flexibility in designing the event webpage. I understand Eventbrite's need to use their branding and layout, but it would be helpful if you could edit the event webpage to match your branding such as add more pictures, upload a background color, use different texts, and colors. The webpage now just features a photo and logo of your choosing then it's pretty bland.","Overall: Overall, I have enjoyed my experience with Eventbrite. It's great to use, an easy platform, tracking is very easy, and the functionality for both web builders and users is easy to understand.",

Checkout/Event Registration is simplified and very easy. I especially love the feature where if I am not logged in the platform and I am registering for an event, on clicking login link adjacent to user identification dropboxes, changes the input boxes to appropriate input boxes for login and on login, the details are auto-filled in the earlier displayed input boxes.","Cons: Most of the time I have used it, some filters do not work for me. For example as per the time of writing this review, when I select the period of the event eg All Dates, Tomorrow, Next Week etc and click on search, it takes me to https://www.eventbrite.com/notavailable.",Overall: Awesome considering it has enabled me to be up to date in regards to tech events happening in Kenya. I have learnt a lot from these events and met great people in these events.,

We no longer have to handle cash or cards at our events. The payouts and reports is excellent.,Cons: The templates are not as creative or flexible as some other platforms. I would like a few more options on the template side for emails and then Ii may use the product for more of our marketing pieces. At the moment we couple Eventbrite for ticketing with Mailchimp for marketing.,,
2289,eventbrite,Eventbrite is becoming more and more popular!,Tamieka G.,Program Coordinator,"Health, Wellness and Fitness, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-07-10,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,,"Pros: I love the fact that you can search for events by category and or/city with Eventbrite. Being that it's so easy to use, and becoming more and more popular, many people use the software for all types of events. You have the typical popular events such as shows and concerts, but people are using it more and more for nontraditional uses, such as weddings and baby showers. It's very easy to navigate through the site, and easy to RSVP, sell/buy tickets, and create your own personal event. It shows you the price ranges for events that have cover charges, which is a very cool feature and it even tells you when events are free. It even shows you a map of where the event is located. It's definitely a great product!","Cons: There is nothing that I don't like about the product, it does a really great job at advertisement and creation of events.",,
2290,eventbrite,Start-up event lovers' dream!,Verified Reviewer,Program Coordinator,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-11-23,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,,"Pros: As someone closely follows start-up events, I think Eventbrite is such a useful and easy to use application. As you browse through events you can favourite it or add it to your calender for reminder and read the description of the event to decide if you want to go. You can see its address and location on map (useful and necessary when you're in a hurry on your way to the event) and see other similar events. I use it to find and share interesting events with my colleagues.","Cons: The variety of events are limited to formal or business events so at times I forget to look at Eventbrite when I'm searching for more casual events. Also the ""About"" section is very useful however when you click on ""Read more"" you are directed to another page. I wish it had a one sentence summary before ""Read more"", the sentence before it usually is interrupted and you don't get an overall idea without clicking on read more.",Overall: Browsing and getting ticket to the event is simplified and I would recommend it.,
2291,eventbrite,Great application for Events that are Free,India O.,Adjunct Professor,"Higher Education, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: GetApp,2018-11-16,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,6.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite has my vote for an easy to use platform to offer and market events that are offered for free. The ability to reserve a space and get confirmation is value added. The app includes reminders keep the events you signed up for top of mind. Another favorable feature is the ability to search for ""Eventbrite Events Near Me"". This feature allows for impromptu outings that are often low cost. The ability to filter by mood, categories, dates or to be surprised help to hone in on the right event for your situation.","Cons: If you are planning to use EventBrite to sell tickets the platform gets more complicated and structured, including the limited ways in which you can receive money for tickets. My professional organization considered using it for small fee ticket sales for member events but the rules and at the percentage taken by EventBrite were restrictive to the point that we didn't move forward. However, EventBrite offers three pricing structures so if you are planning a complex event, wish to get analytics from your event, reserve seating, or need on site staffing and support and have a margin of profit, then EventBrite is worth exploring.",,
2292,eventbrite,Great idea ... but really bad and extremely slow customer support!,Gregory P.,Musical Director,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2017-07-12,5,4.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,6.0,,Pros: The COST can't be beat. It's great to be able to do this without fees of other traditional Ticketing agencies charge,Cons: really bad and extremely slow customer support! I emailed a question after waiting on hold on the phone for over an hour and got a response A WEEK LATER. Pretty bad!,,
2293,eventbrite,Great for planning events that require tickets,Verified Reviewer,Musical Director,"Events Services, 51-200 employees",Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,2018-05-09,4,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,7.0,,"Pros: I used EventBrite to create and distribute invitations to our company's annual holiday party. I was able to input all of the event's details rather quickly and easily, and was even able to upload the invitation that I designed to add it to our 'page' for our event. It's sleek looking, and was fairly straightforward to configure.","Cons: It's not very intuitive. It took me quite a few Google searches just to figure out how to send a reminder email to all of the non-responders. We also had a number of people email us separately to RSVP for our event, and it was rather clunky (and not obvious) to try and add attendees manually. This reason alone will be why we use different software next year.","Overall: This software is great (probably even the best) for users who are planning events that have a ticketing system associated with them. If you're hosting a simple party that won't have a ticketing system implemented, such as a holiday party, birthday party, etc, this software is a bit of overkill. Overall, it allowed me to achieve my goal, which was to invite people to our holiday party and be able to track the RSVPs.",

- Great for tracking data and registration purposes

- Attendees can use this to check in to events with ease using .pdf or app

- Lots of opportunities for customizing - search fields, graphics, etc.

- Decent customer support and help available through the website

- All-in-one place - no need to multiple platforms to accomplish these goals","Cons: I don't have many things to complain about with regards to Eventbrite and my experience using it. There was a steep learning curve, as I was new to the platform, but I was able to find help with ease. Depending on your budget, it may be pricey, but consider your long-term goals to decide if it's worth it.","Overall: Positive experience, but I feel that I have a lot more to learn about this platform in order to use it to its fullest potential.",
2295,eventbrite,Software for all levels of experience,Staci H.,Director of Events,"Public Policy, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-10-24,4,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is easy to use for all levels of planning experience. It's a great tool for free events, as well as paid registrations and ticketed events. The back end of the software is easy for planner (and non-planners) to use. Their customer service is really wonderful. They can set your non-profit organization up quickly to receive lower transaction fees. I don't receive many complaints about the software.","Cons: The only downfall is the challenges in getting 'just the right' logo/image dimensions on the registration page or in the description page. There's not much customizing in those areas, particularly in the description/text area for the main page. It's really a plain text only option.","Overall: I've had a great experience with Eventbrite. I've primarily used them for free events, but a handful of paid events as well. I would recommend them for a 'do it yourself' registration option.",

It works just fine. I also love the fact that you can select the type of info you wish to collect from attendees and create a zap in order to have the info transferred to a spreadsheet without having to type it. This automated process is just lovely.,Cons: When you have to charge for tickets the process fee is kind of high. Other than that everything is good.,,

I like knowing that Eventbrite makes it easy for my attendees to add the event to their calendar. An added bonus is the social sharing.","Cons: I would like better integration with Wordpress, and the ability to integrate Eventbrite seamlessly into my Wordpress pages. However, this isn't a huge deal since most of the time I wouldn't invest the time and effort to design and code a custom web page.",,

I like the ability to add a photo to my event page and how I instantly receive notification about new registrants to my event ,showing me their name and email address.",Cons: I will like to be able to ask registrants for my event more complex questions during the signup process ; however Eventbrite doesnt let me do this,,

This platform has all of the tools that I deem necessary to plan and accommodate small events that I often have to plan for my job. It easily allows me to send out invites, manage guest list, send reminders and register attendees when they arrive. It works so well, that I would easily pay for the service that they offer because they truly are an invaluable asset. Eventbrite has saved me when I literally had 5-7 days to set up an event and manage guest and there needs in order to pull of successful events. Always top of mind for me.","Cons: Eventbrite customer service is limited to none. Thus, that is a major red flag. With any event management platform that's selling tickets for actual money. I can guarantee that some issue would pop up at some point. So to have poor customer service that just wouldn't work for me.","Overall: I have had great experiences with this platform. However, it should be noted that I have only used the free option because the events I have are free. I haven't had any major concerns because these events I plan have a maximum of about 75 people. So great tools available depending on your needs.",

You can use your own theme and graphics or they have lots of great themes to choose from. I like being able to make it a free rsvp only event or one people can pay for and that you can check people in that have already registered once they get to the event! So helpful!","Cons: I can't think of many cons to Eventbrite, but if I had to choose something, I'd say sometimes when I create my own theme that it saves with a funny color and when I choose a different one, it didn't save. Not a huge deal, thought.",,
2302,eventbrite,Eventbrite works great because it makes the registration process easier and keeps it all together .,Mahala W.,Office Administrator/Manager,"Religious Institutions, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-04-19,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Its an easy way to see how many people are registering, as well as tracking how much you made for that specific event. Also, the cost per transaction is not bad.","Cons: We had an event where the check was never cut or sent to us for over 6 months. Normally it is suppose to be sent immediately after the event. We did finally receive it, but it was only after we requested it.",Overall: We mainly like the ease of use and also tracking for each event.,

It's also better than constant contact as it allows you to personalize the event and make it really pop.",Cons: I think they could try to include more features into the events i.e. a customization of the page and more. Similar to how constant contact allows you to customize how the page will look.,Overall: Love it!!,
2304,eventbrite,The basic functionality is a cost-effective way to create online sign-ups for ticketed events,Brent K.,General Counsel,"Primary/Secondary Education, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,2019-01-09,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,9.0,,"Pros: Cost--if you're not creating paid events, you can keep your usage very inexpensive. If your IT Department doesn't regularly build sign-up sites for you, this can give you easy functionality on a shoestring budget. It can be an appreciable cost for low-cost events (because the pricing would comprise a higher percentage of each ticket's revenue), but if you don't have a payment-processing solution, or don't have the financial controls or manual functionality to collect payments, then it's likely worth its value to you.","Cons: If you don't go with a custom design, your audience may recognize that you opted for a budget-oriented solution. That may not be the kind of client signaling you want to send, but the potentially low cost has to come with some kind of trade-off.",,

We have at least one a year, including our main fundraising event. This has simplified the ticket sales situation and we have even added our sponsorship opportunities to the site. I like that you can make donations through this as well. It is beneficial that the purchaser pays the processing fee.","Cons: While I like that it asks the purchaser to pay the fee, I wish we had the option to give the purchaser the choice as to whether or not they paid it. While this might seem a bit contradictory, there are different mind sets with making a donor or ticket purchaser pay the processing fees. I appreciate it, but some feel the fees are the cost of doing business and that should not be passed on. So I wish we had the option to make that choice.",,

We use it for endurance events and banquets but endurance events are harder to tailor and they are better at ticket events.,Overall: They are our registration system for all events and they connect to our CRM API for integration so it merges our constituents. They also send info to Crowdrise for the peer-to-peer fundraising.,

It functions in both the region. In las vegas they have a huge market, where they plan, promote, and sell all the show tickets and they are linked up the engineering department of regional schools and state university.","Cons: it is considered as one of the largest event community spanning all over america and such perfect planning of an event is also needed to outrun this software. in short, i am not so sure about this software's negative side. i would say their service fees and fees per ticket percent rate are high and it does affect the reach of audience attendance.",,

I love how easy the process of using the app (from start to finish) is, and how easy it is to track sales and metrics along the way.",Cons: Nothing major - Eventbrite blows any competing apps I've used out of the water.

Support is available 24/7 online. Some of the event management features include attendee, badge managing along with vendor management tools. They offer promoting tools for social media, surveys, feedback options. The volunteer management tool is easy to use. Offers lot of functions to manage and organize any event. Could integrate with SurveyMonkey and possibly other tools.",Cons: Some of the settings are not as user friendly. The custom data fields aren't super clear to navigate. The customer service is not the most reliable. There are some limitations on reporting such as not being able to print reports based on names of registrant. Great tool if you're running smaller events.,Overall: I used EventBrite in the past and it's effective at executing events.,

There is pay function but I haven't used it. I've used it for promo events I have and want to advertise it out to people. It goes online free to anyone searching for events in my area. It's a great tool to track and take payments if you want. It'll get all the information from your people enrolling so you can track them for the future. I network with other small businesses and they all use it from instructors like me for an event to coaches and financial advisors.","Cons: I can't complain about this software as it is free. Maybe I might if I were paying on using it at a different user level, but it's such a nice tool for a small business to promote events. So many of us use it.",Overall: It's a nice well known tool for small businesses or non-profits to use when they have an event to promote whether it is free or paying.,

I was a littlw hesitant to use Eventbrite at first because it would take thw customer away from my webpage but the customisation options allowed me to really focus on making my events personal to my busibess. I would get updates the instant someone signed up for an event or a sale that I promoted with EventBrite. They offer an outstanding product and will use them again in the near future,Cons: I do not have too much bad to say about EventBrite other then the customer has to leave my page in order to go to the event page. I wish there was an integrated wigit I could use to bring Eventbrite to my social media platforms,Overall: Im trying to bring customers together and get them excited about what we have to offer.

We offer around 18 different webcasts that repeat every month, so being able to set them up without having to do it all from scratch is nice.","Cons: I don't like it that we are using another piece of software to handle registrations, Eventbrite works great, but our webcast strategy needs some work. We should be using a webcast software that handles registrations so it's a one-stop experience for attendees. This is not a knock against Eventbrite, it's a knock against us!",,

I use this site for both personal and professional use. In my personal life, I use it to book and register for events I am interested in attending. When I want to find unique activities happening in my city, I always go to Eventbrite first. I have used this site many times in the past as an organizer, since I am an Event Planner. Eventbrite is so easy to use and helps track me attendance, allows me to send follow up emails to attendees, processes payment from guests...it has been an absolutely lifesaver to me and I could not recommend it enough.",Cons: I have nothing negative to say about this product.,,

Super easy","Pros: Eventbite! You integrate so seamlessly into facebook! I love you! Easy set up, click and drop, format with low fees and great integration. Easy. Easy and good looking. I even got customers outside of my regular group of folks who attend my events.","Cons: I mean I guess that the website does take a nominal fee from each ticket sold, you can pass that on to customers but I wouldn't. I had some work-around in implementing to my website but they were easily fixed and were more on the end of Squarespace than eventbrite.",,

Simple web interface makes it easy to interact with and delegate actions to others.","Cons: There are always one-off issues with invitees, and it's a bit cumbersome to manage these one-offs.

A good follow-up from the mobile phone, would bring better results.",,

Eventbrite is giving us almost all of the same features without the huge price tag. We can customize the questions so we can easily gather all of the information we need from each attendee. We can schedule reminders to attendees and those who still need to register. We can have all the information we need about attendees and track any changes they make to their registrations in one place. We also used eventbrite to sell tickets for a concert we held last year and it was fantastic. Easy for ticket buyers and we were able to pull lists for the concert that made guest check- in a snap.","Cons: If your event is not a ticketed event it does require more thought and planning to make eventbrite work. That said, it is doable bacuse the pages are flexible, they can be customized.",,
2322,eventbrite,Easy Event Prep,Jenna G.,Regulatory and Safety Tech,"Oil & Energy, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-12-04,5,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: There are a number of options you can include when sending out event invitations. Minimal hassle for set up. You are able to track ticket sales in real time. It eliminates manual tracking. For participants, all the information they need is ready in one location and tickets are distributed right to their email.","Cons: The app is great. However, when using the computer you need to sign in for every event email you receive and multiple accounts can't be linked. One email address per account and you need to sign in every time.","Overall: Great for events of all sizes especially when the RSVP requires the guest to make choices. Whether it is a large charity gala or an office Christmas party, Eventbrite is easy to use and makes organizing very simple when accommodating guest preferences.",
2323,eventbrite,Perfect for Planning Events,Jeffrey A.,Marcom Manager,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-07-06,4,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,10.0,,"Pros: Our company is constantly holding events for all our distributors around the US. There are a LOT of great features but the cost absolutely can't be beat. Other apps/programs/software have so many added fees for random features that it becomes an expensive hassle to even hold a single event. Not so with Eventbrite. We'd been burnt before with all the little hidden fees that it took some convincing the higher ups to get on board with Eventbrite. Now? They love it. Haven't looked back. It's an easy, hassle-free way to send out mass invites for an exceptional price. Just pump the link into an email and you're good to go. You can even have customizeable discounts and promo codes. I can keep going but I'll save you the reading. If you're using a different event planner, switch over. You'll get glad you did.","Cons: I don't like fishing for cons when there aren't any readily apparent, but if I had to say one negative thing about Eventbrite, it would be the customer service. You'll rarely have need to get in contact with them, but when you do it'll be a struggle. A few more reps, some more training, and an overall cheerier disposition would do them wonders.",,
2324,eventbrite,"Practical Tool For Events, Not Without Flaws But Worth It",Alicia M.,BRIDGE Area Director,"Philanthropy, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2019-01-08,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,9.0,,Pros: Eventbrite makes setting up event invitations and ticket sales seamless for even an inexperienced user. Their template works for almost an function and navigating is fairly intuitive. Many people are familiar with Eventbrite so they're willing to go through the step of clicking into an additional link after reading about the event via social media or email.,"Cons: The customizations options are limited. There are not enough options to ask additional questions or gain event related information from the user. The backend data is not easy to access, use or transfer into other applications. While they are cost effective for small organizations, don't be fooled. The fees add up quick. Their per ticket cost is reasonable, but their credit card processing fees are high per industry average.","Overall: When it comes to the simple process of creating a ticketed and/or registered event, it can be done simply and quickly with Eventbrite. Customer service is quick to answer questions via chat or email. It does have limitations; however, without paying a subscription cost, it is still an industry leading tool.",
2325,eventbrite,I would not recommend Eventbrite,Mary Lee C.,Writer and Editor,"Writing and Editing, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2019-06-20,1,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,9.0,,"Pros: While I do not actually like anything about this software itself, I do like that, although with considerable difficulty, it enables me to book online for events. I simply wish that events would use different software in order to achieve the same end result of allowing booking online.","Cons: I find this software unwelcoming and overly complicated to achieve a seemingly simplistic task. It is even difficult to sign in, and I am rarely sure, even after receiving a confirmation e-mail if I have booked correctly. As a result, I regularly waste time calling the event venue the next day, if a number is provided, to check that all details have been accurately received, and often (not always, but more frequently than I regard as reasonable), despite having received a confirmation e-mail, had I not checked with the venue, I was not booked into the event, which for events with limited space is, of course, potentially especially problematic. As a culture writer, attending arts events is an important aspect of my job, and it is a great time waster and strain whenever an event is done entirely through Eventbrite, as I must check anything possible and still be nervous that I will have trouble attending a sometimes necessary event.","Overall: My experience of Eventbrite has been very poor. It adds a great deal of time and worry to my working day whenever I have to use Eventbrite and follow up on it. Whenever possible, I avoid Eventbrite, and I have found that with some events and venues, while Eventbrite claims there is no availability, if one is able to circumvent Eventbrite and book directly, there is availability, so Eventbrite often seems a useless, even frustrating and counterproductive, unnecessary 'middle man.' I have had so many variedly negative experiences with Eventbrite, that recently, I decided for events that only book through it, if the event can be missed, it is more productive to not attend the event than deal with Eventbrite.",
2326,eventbrite,THe best way to create an event,Natalia R.,CEO,"Telecommunications, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-11-13,5,5.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,9.0,,"Pros: I use for a long time Eventbrite for creating some events. Is very easy to use, export and manage all the things that you need.

With some clicks, you can create tickets and control your visitors.","Cons: To be honest, I love Eventbrite. Maybe that you can have more control about RRSS and the users that comment about your event",,

I also wish it would integrate better with other mainstream software, like Hubspot - although you can create smart lists, you still need Zapier to transfer over attendee information.",,
2328,eventbrite,"Great software, at a price",Mike R.,IT Manager / Web Developer,"Newspapers, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-10-31,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,8.0,,"Pros: Everything Eventbrite does is spectacular. They make it beyond simple to create, manage, take payment, check-in attendees in their app, and receive payment. Even things that seem tricky like adding waivers to tickets and adding custom fields for additional data are extremely simple to use and access. Basically, everything just works as expected.","Cons: Now, with great software, I understand does come a price. However while their fee structure has changed over the years, I still maintain they are taking too large a cut of ticket sales. While the exact percentage does change based on your plan and the price of the ticket you're selling, we consistently see 30% or more of our ticket sales revenue go to to Eventbrite. Again I do understand that you do need to pay for great software, I just wish Eventbrite either took a lower percentage or offered a flat fee option.","Overall: Overall we are extremely satisfied with Eventbrite. Yes, I think their fees are too high, but in terms of actual functionality, Eventbrite pretty much does everything we need it to do extremely well.",

I like most that it saves your ticket information in a virtual wallet. It also tracks all your purchases. It has been a while since I acquired the app from the apple app store, but I believe it was suggested to download the app to mobile devise to have access to all the cool features.",Cons: The software always asks to use your current location. I have found that allowing access to current location can trigger the app to run in the background of you mobile device. This can also ping you for advertisements that are not wanted.,Overall: The app tracks my events that I have purchased virtually. This is helpful to keep track of events that where not solicited by the user but rather by invitation.,
2330,eventbrite,Have been using this software for years.,Donald A.,owner,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,2018-06-04,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,10.0,,Pros: Ability to sell tickets over a wide audience. Easy to upload mailing list. Helps maintain a customer database.,Cons: Fee structure and processing. Fees for events never remain consistent. And there should be a way for fees to be deducted at time of purchase as opposed to later via invoice.,Overall: easy to use ticketing software with html links.,

It has lots of functionality and control. For example, you can set special ticket type, make tickets available or unavailable at specific times/dates, set promo codes for speakers or discounts (e.g. for students). Payment processing is done by Eventbrite and then transferred electronically to an account you indicate. Fees are quite low and easily incorporated into ticket price (which you can choose to be visible or not to the end user). Very intuitive. You can be up and running in no time.",Cons: Eventbrite usually only pays out after your event. So if you are counting on the money from pre-ticket sales to be in your account prior to event - this is not the right option.,,
2332,eventbrite,Because a party without people is just sad,Osa L.,Marketing,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-07-18,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,,"Pros: When you have an event or a cause and you need to get people's attention, you need to get people to come and participate, then Eventbrite is one of the easiest platforms you can use. Not only will your event be posted online, but it will also be easily searchable by google so that if people search for something that your event covers on google then your event can pop up. Better yet, people often go to eventbrite just looking for events to participate in, and when they see your event, they may decide to attend even if they were never even looking for your event.","Cons: Eventbrite has access to your contact list, and some people may not be comfortable registering with eventbrite because they don't want their information being too publicly available. In that case you can probably provide multiple options for registering for your event.",,

- support for beginners (those who are using the software for the first time)

- free (if you have no event registration fees)

- great tool to have if managing simple events","Cons: - as soon as you create the event, it becomes public. I once had a speaker event created for my students (and it was a free event); and I had 3 external to school people signing up for it. Took me some time to go over the RSVP list to make sure nobody else external was there.

- not a very helpful tool if you event has multiple sessions/registration tracks/etc.

- very limited customization options",Overall: My overall experience with Eventbrite has been good. It is perfect for and easy to use when managing smaller simple events. It also looks professional.,

IT is easy, straightforward, and very accessible. The best feature is it is all online, instead of requiring one to leave home or stand in a line to purchase event tickets.","Cons: I can't think of anything negative. I would like to utilize the software at some point for an event of my own, but I will have to study up on how to schedule and promote through them.","Overall: so far, I have only purchased tickets through this technology, but I intend to utilize its awesome potential on future sales events of my artwork and writing. It is clearly the dominant choice for ticket sales and event promo.",

Only frustration is the inability to modify number of people in a booking without deleting it and starting again.",

Eventbrite has basically come handy for me. With Eventbrite ,I am able to register for events and get sent an invite to my mail.

I like that it is simple to setup for us and simple to use for the user. As a user, I have signed up for several events with no fuss.","Cons: Although I do love that it's simple, you don't have many options when it comes to design and making it feel like your brand. Other event companies we have used allowed for more customization. But really, in the end, people don't seem to care and a lot of our clients are used to this platform. They also recently changed their pay structure which wasn't as ideal as before but I imagine they had to make the decision as they were giving away a lot for free before.",,

Everything is self explanatory. There are lots of great events to pick from. Everything is organized and location is automatically set from your phone,Cons: What I enjoy least about this app is that not all events happening in the area are on here. That is about the only thing,Overall: I really enjoy this app. It has been ingrowing for the last few years and it has became into something really great. Everything is organized and put into whichever topic you may enjoy. Only downfall is that not all events happening in the town are on there but it is what it is.

I've never actually posted on Eventbrite, but I use it regularly. It's the best events site I've ever used. It's super easy to navigate and find cool events happening in my area. I've visited other event sites, but none of them are as user-friendly as Eventbrite. With other sites, my ticket always gets lost and it's SO hard to find it, but with Eventbrite it's always really easy to find.

If I see venues/performers/events using Eventbrite as their platform to sell tickets, I'm always more inclined to go because I know that purchasing tickets will be easy and hassle-free.","Cons: Honestly nothing, it's so easy to use and convenient.",,

It's super easy, it integrates perfectly with Facebook and mail chimp. I use it will every event I create. The app for scanning tickets and payment is great. I can edit and create events with the mobile app which isn't great for on the go, plus it's practically free to use.","Cons: The only con I can across was Recently when I tried to update my tickets start and end date. I opened the Eventbrite app and was unable to edit ticket info, so I logging on directly to site from my phone and then I was able to make changes. Maybe there's a glitch or I don't know where to look",,

Once the event is created is is super easy to share, promote and keep track of sales. I love that I can use the software from my laptop as well as my phone using the Eventbrite organizer app.","Cons: Setting up an event can be tricky, especially if you are trying to set up more than one type of ticket, and it takes a little bit of time to get through to customer service if you need them.","Overall: We have used Eventbrite for 6 years to set up an annual event, and once we got past the learning curve on that first setup it has been smooth sailing!

Whether it be a paid event or a free event, the whole process of creating and listing an event on the site and then getting people to register is an extremely seamless process. I have used Eventbrite to organize one school event and it was great because we were able to get a general idea of how many people we were expecting to show up!","Cons: There's definitely not a lot of ways that Eventbrite can get your event a lot of attention unless you share it on social media. For small events, this can be particularly hard to get attention from people that may not be in your immediate network. I think Eventbrite definitely needs to work on how to better improve how events can be promoted.","Overall: My overall experience with Eventbrite has been great and I would highly reccomend for others to give it a try.

Besides the required 'ease of use' and 'intuitive design' of their site I have to honestly say that I like all the controls the platform gives me. I can easily create different ticket options, discount codes, tracking links, invitations (which also allow me to invite attendees of previous events I've hosted on the platform) and can manually add any users (such as comp tickets for media) to the system without incurring any fees. I can also easily repeat an event with one click, which saves any custom tickets or pricing and also allows for easy updates. Their integration with social media is helpful, and they are always making updates to their offerings. They also have promotional tools to help you reach an audience outside of your usual base. The nonprofit organization I work for has conducted over 70 parties, tours, classes, etc with Eventbrite, and I consider them a partner in helping us produce great events and helping me raise money for our educational programs. I also appreciate that they are growing as a company. I never feel that their 'resting on their laurels' when it comes to the design of the site or the tools offered. Even after working with them for a number of years, I still call tech support to get questions answered if I can't figure it out quickly on my own, and their staff is helpful and nice. All in all I give them an A+. They make my job easier, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for an online ticketing company.",,,,

From easy to manage organizer features and reporting options, to easy to find events and reminders for when they're coming up, Eventbrite helps me feel connected to the places I am, and helps me connect with the people where I'm hosting events!","Cons: I wish there were some more page customization options, as well as date options (for example to let someone know that the event occurs across three days, each day 9-3, but that it's one event, not three separate events) has been a struggle for us.",,

I live in the Miami, FL area and it has been a life saver when not knowing where to go with friends. The events are always well described and not too expensive. The app is also extremely easy to use.",Cons: My only con for Eventbrite is the fact that it doesn't have a counter for how many people have bought tickets to an events so you don't really know how big an event is til you arrive. I also know of a few friends that have bought tickets to a none existent event at a random location.,"Overall: Overall Eventbrite is a great way to stay in touch with your community and participate in all sort of events in your area, but you do have to look out for fraud and maybe look more into an event before buying a ticket.",

It's easy to set up, share, and track. We can also download our attendee list in order to email them through our email software. There are excellent statistics and information that we can use to compare events and year over year results.","Cons: The fees continue to increase, so on some ticketed events we only receive about 65% of the gross sales. The app only shows gross sales, so we have to remember to do the math to see our actual net income. We often pass the fees on to our attendees, but in some cases that inhibits ticket sales.",,

It is pretty easy to use and quick to set up. Payments are based on tickets sold, so you pay only if you sell tickets. Free tickets are not charged. It is possible to create different types of tickets, hide some special tickets (and give a special code to give the access only to some people) and create discount codes. I embedded the ticketing widget on my event website so attendees were able to buy tickets without leaving my site.",Cons: The fees applied to the tickets are a bit expensive. The confirmation email should have a customizable template to fit with my company's guidelines.,,

It has a user friendly platform, handles all payments/refunds, and has reasonable fees. Eventbrite has also become a go to destination for finding events to attend in my area.","Cons: It would always be nice to have no fees, but we understand that this is a necessary part of business and the longevity of the program. One time we had a problem with transferring of funds to our account after the event was over as they have set times they do this. It was semi-inconvenient but not a deal breaker.",,

I have used this many times during my time as a college student at Cal. Most events hosted by student groups at Cal use Eventbrite for ticketing. Our organization used Eventbrite to host multiple clubbing events in SF and to collect ticket sales. I enjoyed how there are referral links/codes to help track ticket sales from other organizations helping us sell tickets.,Cons: I did not really have a problem with the software. I do wish that there was more customizability for event pages though so it can really pop and stand out.,Overall: I enjoyed my experience.,

It's very easy to use and has great reporting, dashboard, etc. We are a member organization and would benefit from Eventbrite integrating with a CRM which it currently doesn't do.","Pros: Nice dashboard, easy reporting.",Cons: Customer service is hard to reach and sometimes it can be slow.,,

You can set up alerts to automatically email your guest list reminders to RSVP, to attend, etc. It is easy to register outside users who may not have used the platform before.","Cons: Not always the most user friendly. It can take a while to figure out all the features, and can be tedious triple checking that all the emails are set up correctly. Emails can also be filtered into the wrong folders in many emails platforms.",Overall: I have used Eventbrite several times to send out invites for events I was hosting at work. It had the name recognition to keep people less than skeptical of the event.,

Interested participants usually have to book a ticket for our event on eventbrite and this gives our company and events we organize a professional outlook .

Eventbrite also enable us make adequate preparations in terms of hall size ,refreshments etc for the participants coming ,by providing us with vital data like the total number of potential attendees for our event ,ensuring we are never caught unawares.

Lastly ,whenever we create free events on Eventbrite , random interested parties stumble upon these events by accident and book a ticket ,therefore I can say Eventbrite also gives us free adverzement.","Cons: Eventbrite limits the level of questions we can ask people to respond to ,before booking tickets for our events. Thus we are unable to ask conditional or tricky questions.",,

I have organized events and registered for events through Eventbrite. It is seamless and easy to purchase tickets when registering for events and even easier to create an event! It has custom settings to choose from to create your own unique style for the event. I haven't used any other website since discovering Eventbrite!,"Cons: Truthfully, nothing! It satisfies everything I need in an event planning website.",Overall: Extremely satisfied! This is the only site we use to organize events and it's always a relief when local events are using Eventbrite because it is so amazing! It's easy to share the event over all social media platforms.,

They have both web and mobile application, which is extremely helpful. 2. I have used this app to book tickets during extreme rush. But It never let me down it did not crash 3. From user point of view, many organizers use eventbrite as a event management platform so I feel there is more viewers than any other applications 4. Lite UI in the mobile app. Do not slow down my mobile.","Cons: Its very difficult to find a con in this type of app which I weekly use and never faced any issue. Anyways, 1. I saw many times spam posting, specially in India. So I think posts should be more regulated",,

Would like to have a a the ability to add a little more customization.,"Overall: Due to the ease of eventbrite, it's a great option for anyone with events big or small. Set up is quite simple and the instructions are quite clear to follow. There seems to be a good number of folks who are already familiar with this systems which makes things more efficient all around. It won't disappoint!",

Its user interface is very intuitive and allows the creation of a smooth experience for users going through the event registration and ticket purchase process. The tool has advanced features which allow automation of event reminders, application of coupons, site embedding, and integration with google maps. I simply love this tool.","Cons: I cannot really point out any flaws with this tool's event creation functionality. It does a really great job in that regard, but one thing I do not like is that EventBrite has an event discovery feature, which lists other events listed on Eventbrite. I view that as a distraction for our end users as it can affect the attendance of our own event.","Overall: We use this annually to invite customers to our customer summit. As the person tasked with setting this up, I find the tool intuitive and easy to use. It offers me considerable flexibility in designing an event with numerous choices which make event set up real easy.",
2360,eventbrite,Makes setting up event registration a breeze!,Lauren L.,Creative Coordinator,"Religious Institutions, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-11-20,5,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,10.0,,"Pros: I love that it's a one stop shop for event registration. You've got your professionally designed event page, guests can pay for the event right there, print their tickets, and on the back end there's an abundance of analytics, records, and receipts that I don't have to worry about because it's all there.","Cons: This is just a little thing (and might be fixable) but in the event dashboard, when I want to look at past events, I wish it went in the order of most recent event down than first to last. As we continue to add more events, I'm more interested in easily accessing analytics from our last event.",Overall: We have been easily able to set up a recurring weekly event registration with ease through Eventbrite. It probably took me 30 minutes to set everything up including payment options.,

You can find events happening today, tomorrow or within the next month. You can also search for events pretty much where ever you are and are travelling too. I also love that there's free events and very easy to rsvp to them. The website is very easy to use and everything is clear to see. The app is also very easy to use as well. I haven't created an event on there yet. But when I do have a need too I will definitely use eventbrite for my event needs.",

When attendees arrive at the site, they get a very professional presentation. Up until Cvents recent visual update, this was the best looking software in the game. It's also very easy to use. So if your staff are not experienced event planners, it's no problem! They could learn this extremely quickly.","Cons: I thought it was the best in the business, but it has a lot less flexibility than Cvent and Regonline. Eventbrite is based off of a ticketing paradigm. Since it's a ticket, some advanced options are not available. One problem we run into is that we apply discount codes. If you apply a 100% discount code (someone gets to attend for free, happens all the time), it will cancel the ticket! So then we as event planners have to go back in and re-register people or have them do it themselves. Customer service doesn't have any great solutions for this problem either.",,

There are so many opportunities to interact with and message attendees, which is really helpful when there are updates. I particularly like how Eventbrite automatically sent reminder emails to attendees 48 hours prior to the event, with an option to download or print tickets.","Cons: Eventbrite works very well, but does seem a bit pricey in comparison to other similar softwares. I have never had a problem with Eventbrite, so I guess I am getting what I pay for, but I just wish it was not so expensive.",,
2364,eventbrite,Changed and is now expensive for nonprofits,Grace B.,Director of Development and Community Relations,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2019-07-19,5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,"Pros: We liked that is walks you through step by step when creating events. With it being so popular, everyone knows how to use it too.","Cons: I believe in 2018 they changed their policy and are now taking a larger percentage of profits from the event. As a nonprofit event planner, the percentage they were taking from ticket sales seemed unreasonable. We encourage people to purchase tickets in advance because it helps us plan the event, but we were only getting about 80% of the ticket price and out donors wanted to know why so we switched to a fundraising platform rather than an event platform.",,

When booking events, the app requests one to enter name, email and the number of people attending. There is no hassle. The booking is then confirmed and one can save the ticket and/or share it on social media. It has great features such as promoting, tracking and checking-in. It also offers a secure online payment option, which is easy to utilize.","Cons: Nothing I dislike. As an attendee to many events on campus, I can only talk about the features I have used. Thus far, I could not be happier with Eventbrite. It allows me to organize the events I would like to attend and have all my tickets in one place.",,

It is an easy tool to use to sell tickets and it is pretty straight forward to set up events on Eventbrite and promote them online and via email.,"Cons: The cost of using the service could be seen as a downside when there are other ways to sell tickets that are free (minus credit card or paypal fees). You also receive the fee and then pay Eventbrite, as opposed to the fee directly going to Eventbrite when someone buys a ticket.","Overall: Eventbrite's interface is clean and simple, and figuring out how to customize your event listing is fairly easy. It is also easy to go back in and edit and event. You can export all the registrations into a spreadsheet for easy check in for ticket holders. Eventbrite also helps boost your event because of the search engine optimization and Eventbrite's own tools. Eventbrite will recommend events based on your region or social contacts, thus encouraging more registrations. Yes the service is not free, but it is worth the cost and saves time in terms of registering people and promoting your events.",

You're able to see all that we're invited to the event as well as those who: declined, will attend, or a maybe.

If you have an iPhone, and you choose to attend the event, it will save in your calendar automatically.

It also syncs up to your maps or Waze for directions.

It's like a mini prep for anyone you may not want to see.","Cons: There are no cons with the software.

I prefer the old fashion way of mailing out letters. Times have changed and so I too must change.","Overall: I love it. I haven't had any negative things to say about Eventbrite.

From my review you could see how much I like it.",

We've never thought of using anything else other than Eventbrite! They really ARE THEE Industry STANDARD!,"Cons: You really have to go through the tutorials to properly use this product so I guess you could say it's not as intuitive as one would hope for.

It is pretty easy to set up; in fact, it's kind of hard to screw it up! The whole idea of ticket distribution and money collection is taken care of quite nicely. I can also easily see how many tickets have been purchased, who has purchased, everything that you need in an easy, simple dashboard. I have used it in a variety of settings with never a problem.","Cons: Occasionally, creating event posts leads to nowhere. Once or twice, I've had issues with adding in location or editing the description, that sort of thing. Considering the payout and distribution is seamless, it's a pretty small price to be for that. I think my issues may have been more of an anomaly.","Overall: The collection of funds and the ease of registration make it well worth it. The old-fashioned way of hard tickets at the door is cumbersome for large events - this tells me what I need to know well before the event begins. I also love anything that collects data, such as addresses. Use it, for sure!",

I like that it feels like your getting tickets to something more private in contrast to ticketing software that is so publicly viewed such as Ticketmaster. I like that this is software that any person can use to get work out about their event, it gives it a very ""local"" feel.","Cons: Given the nature of the local-feel, if you are simply pointed to the site because you have an event you want to go to and the link to tickets leads you there, its great. But I think as a standalone app, its not an excellent choice for browsing events as a lot of the ones that turn up are not narrowed down by interest as much as other apps in its category.","Overall: I notice that all of the local events in my town use Eventbrite for their ticket sales -- they tend to be small music venues, dance nights, classes, workshops and similar.",

That is a pro of the application. Their navigation system of looking for events seems fairly intuitive as well and if one is having a casual browse, the app does well in serving that.","Cons: While surfing the application casually can be easy, if one is looking for information in a pinch about an event, it can be a little difficult to find. Many events have to create special rules outside of the app in order to work around what the app lacks.",,

You can invite people and create a space for information. It is widely used among many businesses. It is easy to find information and RSVP to events you are invited to, and it allows syncronization with Google Calendars to automatically add the event to your calendar.","Cons: As an end user, Eventbrite can be confusing and cumbersome. It also feels archaic and restricted to web. I am unaware of any mobile access or app for the service. It also has a reputation of being very business heavy and does not lend itself to social gatherings outside of business.",,

It's easy to see and participate in upcoming events related to your interests. It is also nice to be able to share your views after and before the event as a participant. Thanks to Eventbrite's reputation, as a community administrator, you can easily incorporate many people into your community on any topic.","Cons: It needs to have a free version, especially for non-profit organizations and schools.

As a charter school we used this product for two years to promote and gather registrations for our golf outing and Run/Walk/Bike events. It did what we wanted but the fees just became too much. We have moved to another product with less frills appearance wise but actually more features that has saved our school significant money over Eventbrite.,Overall: The product was good to work with but it seemed like every feature we needed to add was more off of our profit margin for events that we could not afford to lose.,

You can set up a great event page and sell tickets in a matter of minutes.,,Recommendations to other buyers: Eventbrite is one of the easiest event management tools I have come across.

It's a great resource, you can search for events local to you and in categories to suit, we work with young people and check this site regularly to see if anything is happening locally to us that would be good to attend to learn and network with like minded people.

The ability to also collect emails to notify attendees of event information is very useful.,"Cons: If you're using Eventbrite for paid ticketing the 3.5% + fees rate can seem a bit hefty, especially if you're passing it along to the consumer to pay for.

Eventbrite pages also integrate with Facebook, so you can still share and market your event seamlessly! I enjoy using this website b/c my clients receive my call to action (you're invited, please RSVP), without having to pay for a ticket (if I choose), but they still go through the steps of signing up for a ticket, hopefully giving a greater sense of commitment and obligation to attend, vice just clicking ""yes"" or ""no"" on a FB event, which is highly noncommittal.","Cons: I haven't yet mastered how to keep an event private but still have it come up in searches on Eventbrite. I wanted my clients to be able to search for the event (in addition to having the link, you know - cover ALL possibilities), but the only way I could make my event searchable, was to make it public - open to all.",Overall: Highly satisfied! Eventbrite is a regular tool for me as a business owner!,

The process for creating an event is straightforward too. I also like the flexibility, although limited, in branding an event. It's also great for tracking and communicating with RSVPs.",Cons: I dislike having the system create tickets for every event no matter what. We've hosted events before that we wanted an rsvp for but we didn't need people to show tickets to attend. It made it confusing for them and more frustrating than it needed to be for us.,Overall: We publicize events and gather rsvps for attendance.,

That's not to say I might not run into things I hate, but so far, so good.",Pros: I've used EventBrite now for 3 free events. It's easy to create the event and to create a great looking landing page with the tool. I like the options it provides for specifying and then tracking the number of tickets claimed. It seems pretty easy and intuitive for the user on both desktop and mobile platforms.,"Cons: I hate the fees charged for ticket handling. But I don't know any way around it. I haven't done a paid event yet with EventBrite, but the fees look to be the typically outrageous ""handling fees"" that ticket brokers charge. I accept the reality that these folks aren't working for free, but it is really irritating to see a 10% or even 20% premium added to the cost of the ticket for ""surcharges and handling."" Yech.",,

The software is super easy to navigate, and as soon as you launch the home page you will be greeted with tons of info about upcoming events in your area, and around the country. If you download the app its a quick process, and a good place to store your tickets that have already been purchased, which helps if you are an eco-friendly person and want to cut down on paper usage.","Cons: I don't have any qualms with the technicalities of the software, I think the color of the app is eye catching, but I wish that there was more of a pronounced design on the app, from an artists point of view.",,

The fields are well organized and I can preview my event at any time. I like that I can share access to registration information with the people in my company hosting the events. It's also nice that I can limit their view to only see the data they need.,"Cons: Eventbrite is fairly limited when it comes to events that are more complicated. For example, we are planning an event where attendees may choose from dozens of workshops in multiple different time slots. This is not easy to do with Eventbrite.",Overall: Eventbrite is easy to use and makes setting up events a quick and painless process. I like the easy way to process payments as well! Use it.,

Having contact information on file and one-click emailing makes it way easier for people to get in communication with me if there are any queries,Cons: I cannot think of any negatives for eventbrite except that advertising is kind of little expensive for every ticket as there is % + per ticket sold price + credit card processing fee which makes it to about 20% but it is worth it for the advertising we get,,

Inter rates with mailchimmp and Wordpress relitively easily. But if your in Australia you automatically loose out on over half the intergrations available. None of the NFP charity intergrations are good if your outside of the US, Canada is the exception to this rule with a few providers. I enquired about some of the new features they have been aludding to recently on their website, Particularly fundraising intergrations for event participants to collect sponsorship for their event, well customer service was quick to help but despit stressing I was from Australia and they would need to be able to offer their services here but also except an Australian Charity status, they just referred me to intergrations that did neither . Over all great product but feel like I'm missing out with the intergrations.","Pros: Easy to use, setup or booking.","Cons: Intergrations are only for the US, forget about using any of the NFP if your not from the States.",,"Recommendations to other buyers: Basic events, great.

The options are all laid out for you and thought through (such as charging tax, promo codes, etc.). This tool works really well for my company because the event we host annually for our users is less than 100 people, so Eventbrite is an easy, somewhat cheaper option for us.",Cons: There aren't many options (at least with the subscription we have) to design the look of the event page. Eventbrite also limits things like number of ticket types you can have depending on your subscription. The reporting tools of past events are a little limited/confusing as well.,Overall: Works for what we need it to. I'm excited to see how our customers interact with our upcoming event on Eventbrite!,
2406,eventbrite,Free and Easy,Trish W.,Health Coach,"Health, Wellness and Fitness, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-11-19,5,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,10.0,,"Pros: It was really easy to create our events, add banner photos, set up automatic email response with location. It even sends out reminders prior to the events. Is is app friendly so you can scan the tickets too. And, it's a great way to collect client contact information for mailing list too.

We don't require tickets or payment for the events for which we use it. We like that our target audience recognize the name of the software and trust it to RSVP. We also like automatic reminders it sends to those who have registered,"Cons: We did run into some confusion last year for our series of choral reading sessions where the same person was registered multiple times, causing us to expect a larger crowd than actually planned to attend. We assumed it was a user issue -- that they planned to bring a friend or two but chose not to provide specific names. However, it was actually a system glitch. As we use the free version, there was a little bit of difficulty at first when trying to get the issue resolved, but their support team was ultimately helpful.","Overall: It works well for our registration tracking needs, provides easy-to-share links, and sends helpful reminders and directions to attendees.",

We use Eventbrite for ticket sales on one event every year, and I wouldn't use any other system. It's easy to customize how tickets are issued and easy to refund tickets. No problems whatsoever.

Building your event is easy and enables you to create a launch an event within 10 minutes. It's great to use for small sized events, but for larger events the payout process can become a pain. It has great widget items that you can embed like a countdown clock or ticket buyer.","Cons: The new embed feature they use is not compatible with all CMS. If your CMS does not work well with iFrames, you'll have to do 4 extra steps in the creation process in order to use the classic embed code. The map of where the event is located can be glitchy and not show up at all. If you're using the free version, you payout is sent after you event has occurred unless you can have support change it without a fee. There isn't an Eventbrite Wordpress plugin, which would be great as well.","Overall: - Simple to use

- Seamless user experience

- Safe to use for transactional functions

- Great support with great follow through",

In addition, Eventbrite will help you collect money for registration, register people at the door and market your event to the public.",Cons: I wish Eventbrite would take their money from the payments directly vs the user having to return after an event and pay the final bill.

Some of the time, it is helpful not only in finding a location but it is inspiring and give amazing ideas/different options than usual!",Cons: I don't like the fact you are not able to share the event via certain apps (such as WhatsApp) and that some of the times the price for the specific event is not extremely clear.,Overall: Since I started using Eventbrite I started having so many more options for my nights out.

That said, they handle all invoicing and payments, etc, for a pretty fair fee structure.","Cons: They offer reporting on nearly everything, which is great.

I know that the fields can be autofilled and the event confirmations are easy to find later. I used to attend a ton of meetups and events, while it was never too difficult to get signed up. Often the whole process of entering the same data made we want to quite by the second field. It shouldn't take me half an hour to get through this because I'm looking for spending the least amount of time possible. It's been seamless and fast in my experience.","Cons: I once tried to use the platform to find local events that were in my area... that was a mistake. The groupings are difficult to navigate, many events were completely off, the locations I was searching in weren't displaying in a map format, etc. This software isn't for discovery as much as it is for confirmations and organizing.",,

This platform allows me to do so very seamlessly. Since I work for a government agency, all software that use must be free, so this work out perfectly.","Cons: I do not like that I can not add my companies logo (or perhaps I have not figured that part out). I would like the option to personalize the event page as much as possible, but all for free since the agency I work for does not have a budget for this type platform.",,

We use Eventbrite for small events of 10 or so attendees, medium sized events of 50-80 people and large complex, expensive events.","Cons: Eventbrite doesn't have a ton of flexibility when it comes to designing the main page of our events. They do allow us to add a custom graphic or photo, but there are limitations to other parts of the look.",,

Makes tracking ticket sales and attendance super easy. We've been primarily using it for free events, so that's a perk as well.","Cons: It can be a bit complicated to set up different ticket types so there is a learning curve at the start. We don't host a tonne of events on EventBrite so every time we do, we need to refamiliarise ourselves with the process.","Overall: Has really made it easy to post events and coordinate ticket ""sales"" - how many tickets are left, cancellations, waiting lists, etc. Easy to promote on social media.",

It is very easy to work my way around the website, whether searching for an event(s) or if I am clicking an link that's taking me right to a specific event.

You can easily add different payment options for your customers and even add descriptions for what the different options get you. It's great for everything from a golf outing to a simple free event.,"Cons: They take a percent of your ticket sales for operations. Yes, I know they have to operate - however, it would be great if their cut wasn't so high. For me, its a major turnoff when it comes to selling tickets for a high pricepoint. Might be better off looking at other platforms if you're actually selling tickets.",,

I think the product is extremely easy to use, and I never had to ask for help on how to use it.",,Recommendations to other buyers: I think that you should definitely consider it for your small events.

Over all, good experience.","Cons: Eventbrite's service fees, etc. are, in my opinion, a little steep to make sense for most small events. They do provide a lot of value in streamlining the ticket-buying experience for a guest, so it may be worth it.","Overall: We were happy to use Eventbrite for a couple of local music events selling less than 1000 tickets each. Which the fees were steep, they are for any ticketing software.",

As an attendee for conferences, I sometimes loathed having to install the app on my smartphone yet again. UNTIL, I went to a conference that decided to write their own app for attendees. It was a disaster. The custom app was buggy and pretty much featureless. That's when I realized that Eventbrite is the de-facto app to help curate and organize a complex event for attendees. Everything from tickets to itinerary listings, it does reliably and comfortably. It's easy to use for most people who are not tech savvy, while giving some power users some settings to tweak with regards to reminders and ticket/voucher organization (Apple Wallet, etc).","Cons: You might only use Eventbrite a few times a year, but it doesn't stop it from trying to invade your ecosystem with integrations and email subscription. It's easy to untangle and unsubscribe but it can feel like a hassle sometimes.",Overall: Just install it on your smartphone. You're going to use it eventually. And don't even think about trying to be trendy by writing your own app for your once a year event. Just use Eventbrite and enjoy the service that's tried and true.,

It allows you to use your phone as the actual ticket! this is definitely the golden age of technology.",Cons: I was expecting it to show more concert dates for some of the smaller acts. This may be a limitation of the data and not a reflection of the app itself.,"Overall: Overall, I can see this app going even bigger than what it is now. Possibly even being bought out by apple music. Who knows. But for now, it's very reliable and works like a charm.",

It doesn't take long at all. Even someone with no ticketing or event experience can go in and easily figure out through the step by step instructions and info to fill out. More budget friendly than having to get a contract with a large ticketing company!,"Cons: I wish you could have more control at tailoring the interface (fonts/colours/etc) to your needs, but that isn't a huge con.

It's a simple way to collect data and share information in one place. I like that it's not connected to another platform (i.e. Facebook) so it feels more open to many users. You can collect payment through it as well, although I haven't used that feature as an event planner.","Cons: You're still using someone else's software, but I feel more in control with Eventbrite than I do with some of their competitors.",Overall: Planning and attending events.,

For the latter I probably use the site at least once a week. And for creating events I've used it once with no problems - it worked flawlessly for selling tickets and organizing attendees.,Cons: The percentage-based pricing will hit some ticket tiers harder than others.

Tickets can be on mobile device or printed out. Automatically sends ticket confirmation.",Cons: It appears the website automatically changes to a different language (ex. from English to French) if you search for events in a location that uses a different language (ex. somewhere in Quebec). I would rather have all the page options stay as the original language and only the event name is in another language.,,

The best part is some customization is possible in the free version too and the Eventbrite App works smoothly on smartphones.",Cons: Managing events with a larger crowd is not a great experience with Eventbrite as importing and downloading information becomes complex.

Not everyone uses Facebook, so an invite here is better sometimes.","Cons: With all freebie software platforms there are advertisements, it's just annoying sometimes frankly. Also, it would be great if a snail mail option with postal purchasing built in was included. Some people still don't respond or get (believe it or not!) email.",,

Often conference registration is really cumbersome, asks for too many details and has too many pages. EventBrite seems to only ask for just the basics which is fine by me. I get a ticket on my phone and then that's it - I just pull it up when I arrive at the event. I don't have to print anything out beforehand - I just show up and show the ticket on my phone. Very easy experience.",Cons: I can't think of anything. As a registrant I am always happy to see that it is the software being used.,Overall: I think it is the seamlessness between registering on a desktop computer and then showing an admission ticket on a phone that makes EventBrite easy and almost transparent.

The UI/UX is quite clear and havent noticed anything that would stop me from using it. Other than that its up to the creator if he will make the event on facebook eventbrite etc.,"Cons: There isnt really any incentive to use it. I get annoyed that I have to retype things from my account a lot of times but its kinda irrelevant. If someone wants me to sign up through it, I will but thats it.",,

Eventbrite is very well designed, so it is very useful to understand how the things work. The best of Eventbrite is that is free when your event is free! So when I'm organizing a free conversation or conference i know Eventbrite is the best solution to distribute my entrance tickets. Even when is a paid event, Eventbrite only takes the 6% as a commission for the sell and it give me an event page to promote the event and an app to control the sales.","Cons: It could be amazing if Eventbrite implements more payment methods (I know you can use Debit and credit cards), that could be useful in no banked countries. Sometimes people prefers to go and pay physically what they buys.",Overall: You can organize and sell your tickets for your next conference or class.,

But most importantly: I trust them. Having used some shady sites and getting scammed, Eventbrite is a breath of fresh air.",Cons: I find their mobile web experience a bit lacking. That's all I can think of.,Overall: Been using on and off through the years. Always a great experience.,

2472,eventbrite,Bringing events to your computer.,Verified Reviewer,Marketing Manager,"Legal Services, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Software Advice,2018-11-26,4,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,,"Pros: I like the fact that you can just set-up an event if you're organising one. Everyone can sell tickets for their events and that's a good thing, makes your event available to a large audience so you could probably get more visitors by putting it on a website like Eventbrite.",Cons: When you are selling tickets you will have some trouble solving everything. I remember having a lot of trouble with changing events and the available tickets. Had to wait a long time to get a response from their support aswell.,Overall: Overall I like the idea of Eventbrite and it somehow works decent enough. (at the side of customers buying tickets the site is perfect and you'll have your tickets immediatly in your mailbox after paying). But from a seller's perspective I think they could've done a way better job at making it simple and easy to use.,

It is very user-friendly. Anyone can figure it out. You can manage rsvps, updates, pricing/location info, etc. It also keeps a history of your past events.","Cons: Not much that I don't like. I've used other event planning apps/software, but I still like Eventbrite. Maybe they could eliminate or extend the timer that they place on the screen to finish your order before the tickets go back in the pool.",,

The fees are reasonable and we've never had a problem.,"Cons: At first, we found it a little difficult to link Eventbrite to some of the other software we use, including our website, so that people could go to one place for registering. Eventually, we got the hang of it, and now there's no problems at all.",,
2476,eventbrite,Great event registration site,Valerie T.,Graphic Designer,"Hospital & Health Care, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,2018-11-03,5,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,9.0,,Pros: I like Eventbrite b/c of the way it integrates with social media. I can set up my facebook event page and have the option for people to buy tickets right there without having to be re-directed back to eventbrite. That is super helpful and makes us look really professional.,"Cons: I don't like that you can't really customize your event page. I think that was a recent change b/c you used to be able to manipulate colors and fonts for the page, but now the colors automatically generate based on your event header image.",Overall: Eventbrite has been a great tool for selling tickets. I like that you can send email notifications to all or just a portion of your registrants. You can easily keep track of tickets sold and manipulate those controls. And I like the analytics that help you know who is buying and when. Great product.,

Even if you are a small business or an individual looking to book for an event. It sends out automatic emails and reminders, tracks your ticket sales, and embed events right onto your website.",Cons: I would say the only thing I think would be cool is if you could white label this service somehow so Eventbrite's name didn't show up.,,

That being said, you get used to it after a few times using it. Another con, they take out a significant chunk for Eventbrite processing fee. Many platforms take less commission, but are not as popular as Eventbrite (yet).",,

Eventbrite is efficient and super easy to use. It makes life simple in our digital world where mailing invitations is no longer favorable. The Eventbrite softwate helps me get an idea of the event turnout even prior to the event through rsvps/tickets sold, which in turn helps me prep to host/serve a number guests accordingly. One option I enjoy using on Eventbrite is keeping the location as TBA, and releasing the event location info only to those who plan to attend.",Cons: I have no complaints about the Event software.,,

I have been able to easily see how many tickets have been reserved as well as communicate updates, with attendees easily able to cancel or remove their ticket.","Cons: Setting up software took a little time to get used to, but once I had an account and some preferences loaded, the whole process was much easier. Sometimes the recommended events at the bottom have had some company competitors which there isn't an option to remove.","Overall: Eventbrite is a fast, easy way to communicate details and send tickets about the event. With a little bit of time, a user can easily set up both paid and free events. I've hosted multiple events with this software and it's relatively painless to process payments and update the event.",

THEY KNOW THEIR STUFF! They have everything covered for small events like the one I organized (100-200 people class reunion). They also have a great platform for larger events!,Cons: You must have a wi-fi connection to take credit cards at the event.,Overall: I used this software both from my desktop and from their convenient app. I used this to organize a 20-year reunion for my high school graduating class.,

No single person needs 6 tickets to anything, period.",Pros: I use this several times a year to purchase. It's very straight forward and you don't have to worry about discrepancy in prices. I have mainly used this to purchase concert tickets and I usually see that the ticket prices stay stationary rather than fluctuating like other ticket or even websites. 10/10 recommend.,Cons: Something Eventbrite along with most other event ticket selling platforms should really work on is the emphasis they should place on people who are ordering a LOT of tickets at once. There tends to be a clear trend in scalping tickets especially for events in small venues.,,

It made keeping track of the RSVPs and attendees so simple! I was able to export excel sheets with every person who confirmed they would assist, plus the fact that the reminders are sent out automatically and (at least) a paper ticket can be requested for the person to show on their phones or download them, makes them remember about the event even more. When you host a free event it is possible for a lot of people to forget about it or disregard it more easily, but when they have to take the time to download the ticket and so forth, it is more of a commitment. The add to calendar feature is also very very handy.","Cons: Not sure if this is offered (it sure must be), but a pay option with no Eventbrite branding would be perfect and if I use it again I would be glad to purchase it.",,

We used this software to advertise our job fair events. This software allows us to send mass communication to applicants in our ATS informing them about our event and asking them to RSVP for it. It has made the events easier to manage because it gives us an idea of how many candidates we can expect to attend by allowing them to select time slots.,"Cons: The only thing I do not like is that it allows our applicants the ability to select multiple time slots for our events. It would make more sense to only allow them to select one time slot. Allowing the candidate to select multiple times with multiple tickets has inflated some of our numbers, which can be misleading because we think more candidates are going to attend than actually will.",,

Very easy to setup events. We do a lot of free events, but some paid, so the fact that it's super easy to switch between the two is great.

Takes the guess work out of one part of your planning.

I use it to look for cultural events, and I also use it for work to see what tech events are coming up. Additionally, I like that they send me emails based on what I have currently searched or have attended. This helps me to know what is coming up on the calendar.","Cons: It's UX and UI design is a little basic, and not the most pleasing to the eye. This is not a huge deal at all, but it's something Eventbrite could work on for the future.",,

If you don't have the technical know how to build your own registration website and database eventbrite is a great solution. Their infrastructure has allowed our events (both free and paid) to function quite well. Integration with mail chimp was also very useful,"Cons: The one size fits all approach that they have works for the most part, however when organizing an event with several tracks and different components and registration options it became quite cumbersome to set up and manage, and one envisioned portion of the event needed to be slightly changed as we could not figure out how to make registration for that component work (we ended up taking registrations in person at the event for that portion so it all worked out). I also feel that Their customer service could be more responsive","Overall: It was definitely an asset to the organization of the event, despite the small bumps in the road",

Easy to include photos and link a location to the map. The interface is nice and simple. Very trusted platform, so users are not typically turned off by entering their info into this system.",Cons: I have had difficulty with the payment feature. Refunding ticket sales is difficult. Not being able to receive payment until after the event ends is also limiting. You are limited to eventbrite's branding and it is difficult to change the layout to reflect your own company colors/marketing scheme.,,

The events we respond to usually have well over 100 attendees and the response rates seem much higher than a traditional email RSVP.","Cons: Emails can get lost in the shuffle, having the ability to invite through alternate means (i.e. through Slack or other IM services) could be useful for departments that utilize those services.",,

It was extremely easy to keep track of all the orders and create promotional codes.",Cons: I would say the least user-friendly feature I found in Eventbrite was that it wasn't that easy to collaborate with the rest of the team.

We are growing and its time to move on.,"Pros: We enjoyed using this platform because they do allow photo and video integration. They roped us in the first year we worked with them by assigning us a an actual representative, but that quickly changed.",Cons: It feels choppy because each event has to stand alone. They don't necessarily link together as one large event if you are trying to build out separate events for each day or time. Horrible customer service over time. We finally started to pay for their equipment and they didn't answer their phones or emails during our event at all. They also sent equipment that is not compatible by most standards to modern day technology or building codes. They did not seem to care about the aftermath of losing money for our event.,,

As a smaller company not a lot of time and effort is needed to make things look professionally done. Customizing things like the landing page gives you more ownership.,"Cons: Wish we could get more information that our company wants when they register for an event.

I was able to rescind the invitations but took a little bit of time separating my business and personal contact. I would recommend creating to accounts so it separates your contacts.","Overall: Evenbrite helped create and mail off flyer for an event my company was having, best part about it, since the event was free, we did not have to pay for it.",

It clearly stated on the tickets that there would be a person there to check you into the bar crawl until 7pm that day at the Asbury Ale House. I arrived at the Asbury Ale House at 6:30pm and there was no one there to check us in. We got no wrist bands and no sombreros or whatever we were supposed to receive. I asked the bar tenders and hostesses at the Ale House about it and they informed me that the person running the bar crawl left at 5pm! I couldn't believe it. So, I did my own bar crawl and lost money to a stupid company that didn't give me anything I paid for. Then to go further I filed a claim with my bank to get the money back because I emailed Event Brite and they didn't respond. Go figure. So, the bank gave me a temporary refund and I just got a letter in the mail today that says they are taking the money back because Event Brite basically said they won't give the refund. I will not recommend this company to anyone. I will never be using it again. Thanks for nothing, Event Brite.",

This is a major con when using Eventbrite and so it is important to follow up guests after giving them admission passes to confirm that they are coming.","Overall: Overall, my experience with Eventbrite has been good and I would highly reccomend for others to give it a try.

Every functionality is there from coupons to special offers. The website integration works great on every platform and its design is so great and up to date that it fit perfectly within our website. And the responsive functionality makes for such a better experience for our customers. Emails are great and we only had positive feedback about them. Allowing customers to print their tickets and then SCAN them (how amazing is that) once they arrive at the event. On the backend, we could had every information we needed a click away and the feedback presented as graphics gave us great insights about our customers and allowed us to learn about who they are and how to target them.

Weemss is also way cheaper than other companies who offer a weaker product they try to pass off as great when its really not.

So yes, Weemss does offer an amazing experience!","Cons: Well, nobody likes to pay a fee on each ticket, but unlike their competitors, Weemss only take a tiny portion of the profits and use it to create a better user experience for both us - organisers and such - but also the person buying the tickets.

So much that it makes us happy not only to pay less than we would to their competitor, but also to know that the money is used to offer a better experience to our customers.

Because we are based in France, we would have liked a more international experience. Some sentences feel badly translated from english to french, and that's something our customers notice.

We would have loved to be able to fully customize the printed ticket, which we were only able to remotely do.",,

With integrated ticketing and donor services we now know much more about our patrons, how best to reach them, and what they respond to. The result is higher ticket sales, larger and more frequent donations, and generally stronger support of our little theatre. That the software integrates seamlessly with our website and products like Mailchimp and Facebook is a big plus. The help desk is full of articles which are clear and videos which give step by step instructions for the visual learners among us. But the strength of AP is it's people. Every person I have had contact with is a theatre artist. Because of that they really get my organization, why things I think are critical really are (so nice not to have to convince people of what is important!), and how to best solve whatever problem I am having. Recently they have been expanding their marketing tools. I know that there are many more benefits awaiting my organization if I fully utilize the products that Arts People offer. And, Arts People is CRAZY affordable, with very low start up costs and below market fees. Truly the best investment we have made at Ferndale Repertory Theatre.",Cons: They have not yet solved global warming. I am sure they will get on that when they have a free minute.,,

We chose better than we knew!!","Pros: The Ticket Turtle online ticketing system has literally changed our whole world. As a small and growing company, we struggled for years with providing our audiences with a high quality, accessible and easy to use ticketing systems. Ticket Turtle is not only user friendly from the purchasers perspective, it is also incredibly easy to use as an administrator. There are dozens of reports that give you an up to the minute view of all aspects of your ticket sales, detailed database forms to track your audiences, a very flexible donations and contributions system that makes getting donations from patrons a breeze (not to mention generating automatic thank you emails the instant the donation is received) and a versitile ticket pricing system. We will never use another ticketing system, particularly given the incredible level of customer service we have consistently received. We. Love. Ticket. Turtle.","Cons: The only issue we have ever encountered is with the contributions system where it is difficult to process multiple purchased types in a single transaction (ie...buy a ticket, buy season tickets and make a donation all in one transaction). I believe, however, that TT is addressing this for a future version. I would also love to have the option of having TT staff act as ticket sales/phone staff and hope that TT goes down that road to provide that service in the future.",Overall: We love this system and will never use another ticketing system.,

And they did answer our ticketing problems - what they didn't state was that they also would answer my patron management and marketing questions. Having a unified system to manage our patrons allowed us to go from 600 patrons on a hard copy mailing list to over 2400 patrons on our email list and 600 patrons on direct mail only.,Cons: None ! In 4 years I have had less than 5 patrons complain about the ticketing interface.,"Overall: If you need a ticketing and patron management system - this is the one you want. Besides the above features -- it is also web based, which means anywhere you have an internet connection, you have a ticketing office.",

Hand-holding during setup and training

First class support

Seamless integration with your website",Cons: Can't think of any.,"Overall: The setup charges were in the lower range compared to other systems. It has a flexible list and email system. We use it to track our volunteers among other things. It has a membership and donation tracking system as well. Their robust report system provides every kind of information about tickets, comps, donations, and anything else you can think of. They will adjust your pricing for special shows, groups, or whatever, or if your skills are good enough, you can adjust the pricing yourself.



The support from Ticket Turtle has been fantastic! They bend over backwards to make setup go smoothly. Its never been more than a couple hours wait from the time I post a problem or question on their online help request form. And that includes weekends!



The real test of the system for online transactions is the end user. As people enter our theater with their paper in hand, I ask them about buying tickets online. Almost everyone says, It was really easy!",

There are so many other features about Event Master that are so useful; vendor and volunteer management, marketing and promotion codes, other reports.",Cons: There are so many features - I wish I had more time to learn them.

The customer support has also been good. They've been very responsive. I spoke to someone on the phone and he made very helpful recommendations about which promotions to choose for our events.,"Cons: I'm using the free version, so the experience may be different if you use the Event Master version. First, let's look at listing events. You can upload one picture and Spingo crops it two different ways. There is a tool that is supposed to let you show Spingo which part of the picture to focus on, but it does not work at all. Pictures are often cropped strangely or there is spaced left above and below the picture. I'd really like to be able to upload multiple versions of our creative. Also, every time I list an event I have to reenter my information. You aren't able to store it in your profile. Any time you need to edit an event, you have to submit a request. It takes a day or two for the revisions to be made, and sometimes they aren't exactly what you asked for, so you have to ask again. Sometimes the site gets pretty buggy, too. I click edit event and I get taken to the promotion page. I click view event and I get taken to the promotion page. I see old versions of events that were supposed to have been edited or events that I deleted in my account.","Overall: Saves an incredible amount of time, opens up a whole world of reporting capabilities, comparisons to previous years, manage vendors, volunteers, allows to monitor sales and gives better control of our event data and statistics.",

MUST have email traffic within system. Needs to be more customizable to suit different types of events, have the gamer profile was very confusing for our workers/interns signing up. This doesn't pertain to us so it shouldn't even be showing .

If a patron wants to buy tickets for multiple performances of the same show, across multiple dates or times, TicketLeap lets you select everything you want and enter your payment information just once. It's not the cheapest, but it does what I need. Every year I take another look around at what's available, in case I've missed something prettier or cooler or cheaper, but I end up staying with TicketLeap. It's also easy to refund tickets for people that made mistakes. I think I've swapped performances for people too.

Somewhat customizable. Check in was standard. Reporting is descent, can download excel spreadsheets for specific ticket types.","Cons: 1. The top con on my list would be the payout process. Being that my events function based on ticket sales it's important that I have access to funds more frequently then twice per month. Other ticketing systems will pay you out every few days.

It is easy to follow the steps and directions and complete the transaction with ease. I also liked the customer service I received from the very beginning. We had the customer service create the events for us right from the very beginning and did a great job with the events given the amount of information we were looking to collect.,Cons: The countdown clock. Should be able to change the length of time taken to complete a registration and transaction. ...or make it more visible to the customer completing the transaction. I understand why it is there (ticket sales etc) but you should be able to change it per event...in my opinion.,Overall: My overall experience has been great which is why we decided to use your services again in 2019.

The software is very flexible allowing detailed customization specific to your event and ticket process.","Cons: The POS system is somewhat lacking and can be cumbersome when attempting to use the software for sales live at the event. Every year new features are added which helps improve it, but it could still be better.",Overall: We've tried many different ticket companies for our events in the past and Showpass is by far the best with the greatest customer support.

The customer service was extremely patient and helpful with the transition and the online tickets were easily tracked as well. Our teams could see who sold what, when, and how much.","Cons: The one downfall is how the total tickets are calculated if you have packages. The software will count how many packages were sold AND how many tickets within that package were sold. So if I had a package deal of 4 tickets for $X, it would tell me 3 of those packages were sold, with 12 tickets. When you look at total number of tickets sold for the event, it includes the number 3 (for total packages sold) instead of JUST the number of tickets sold. That part does get confusing but isn't a huge deal.","Overall: Overall the experience has been great. Our main issue was that we didn't have codes for our tickets at games so it made it easy for people to replicate them.

4423,sro4,SRO4 saved us!,Alex C. D.,Box Office Manager,,,,Source: Capterra,2015-10-16,4,4.0,,5.0,,,"Comments: In retrospect, I'm still unclear how we were able to function with our old ticketing system. It wasn't until we officially launched SRO4 as our new and improved ticketing system that we became aware of how horrifyingly lacking our previous system was. It's like realizing you accidentally dodged a lethal bullet by virtue of stopping to tighten an unruly shoelace. SRO4 is essentially the shoelace that saved our lives.

I've used numerous different systems during my thirteen years ticketing performing arts organizations, and SRO4 holds its own when compared to some of the bigger names out there. Compared to our previous system, SRO4 is far more intuitive and offers a user-friendly ticketing experience. The reports in SRO4 are a great surprise, offering the flexibility to craft reports specific to the unique demands of our organization while actually reporting back data accurately and in a clean, digestible format.

SRO4's biggest flaw lies in its rules and conditions based logic that applies to almost every aspect of this system. For all of SRO4's brains, it seems to overthinks things too much. For example, programming a specific fee structure for one scenario and differently for another is frustrating beyond words due to the necessity of chiseling through a healthy list of conditions that act as the 'on/off switch' for the fee scenarios. No matter how intelligent you are, you'll quickly find yourself wishing you'd paid closer attention in rocket science class. And with so many layers of interlaced rules and conditions, a slight modification can completely disrupt the functionality of another rule/condition combo that you worked so hard to perfect a week prior. If there's lemonade to be made of these tart lemons, it's that you're guaranteed to come up with some creative combinations of obscenities that are guaranteed to make any sailor blush.

Despite that frustration, the best part of SRO4 is the support we're getting from the TopTix team. These folks are friendly, results-driven, and fast! Did I mention that they're also pleasant and easy to get along with? You bet I did. And I'll say it again, because these essential qualities seem to be withering in the support industry in general. And if you can't enjoy a professional yet relaxed relationship with your support team, well...what's to enjoy? I really love these rock stars! No matter what my situation might be, I always hang up the phone feeling like I'm in good hands with my team.",,,,

4434,accelevents,Another successful online auction with Accelevents!,Jennifer G.,Trustee,"Philanthropy, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,2019-02-09,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,,"Pros: I have used the Accelevent platform to host online auctions for the past three years. We just wrapped up our 3rd online auction and the process couldn't be easier. I love how we can cut and paste auction items and descriptions from previous online auctions. This makes the set up of the new auction so smooth. All of the choices and features of settling the credit card payments are robust and straightforward. The bidder interface is intuitive and easy. We couldn't be happier. It is complex enough to solicit auction items, to set a bid price and to write the descriptions. To have the Accelvent platform so efficient to use with all of the necessary bells and whistles makes the overall experience from set up, to live auction to settlement is seamless and awesome! I love that Accelevents is constantly enhancing the site to accommodate all types of events. I love the new feature of accepting online donations. Also, the customer service is excellent. Someone is always available when I have a question! Thanks Accelevents for another successful event!",Cons: The only drawback is that I could not copy the photos from prior auctions.,,
4435,accelevents,Bringing our silent auctions to the next level,Mark J.,Reverse Raffle Committee Chair,"Fund-Raising, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,2019-02-19,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: I have now used this product for 2 silent auctions at our Band Parents Reverse Raffle. In the past, we would make under $1000 on our silent auctions and would have to deal with the vultures hovering around the tables. With the Accelevents silent auction, people are bidding constantly and I LOVE that my guests get a text message once they are outbid. No longer do they have to run over to the tables constantly to see if they are still the top bidder. They have it all in the palm of their hand. Also, as the primary organizer of the event for 2 years, as ""go time"" approaches, paranoia sets in and I start to second guess whether everything is set to go. This year I messaged them in the wee hours of the morning the night before the event and got an almost immediate response as well as getting some last minute questions answered just hours before the event started. I haven't had the chance to use the other portions of the product, but if they are anywhere near as good as the silent auction, I'm positive they won't disappoint! Thanks Accelevents!!!",Cons: Really have no cons to speak of. These peeps rock!,"Overall: Absolutely fantastic. In the past we have never made over $900 on our silent auction portion of our reverse raffles ... with Accelevents, the past 2 years we have raised $2900 and $1900. So well worth the money.",
4436,accelevents,Our Accelevents online auction was great!,Staley S.,Programming & Marketing,"Civic & Social Organization, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,2019-07-25,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Our organization just completed an online auction as a fundraiser and we used Accelevents as our platform. Everything went very smoothly and the whole experience was a plus, plus, plus! One real benefit to Accelevents was their 24/7 online support. This was particularly helpful to me because I often worked imputing auction data at night, so any questions or small issues that surfaced after business hours could be easily addressed. The team at Accelevents was very responsive and helpful. Our bidders loved the auction site, the mobile capabilities, and found the checkout and payment process was a breeze. At the end of the auction Accelevents provided downloadable spreadsheets of the entire bidding process as well as the winning bidders and their payment details. Another win-win for us was the affordability of the Accelevents rate structure. A final benefit to using Accelevents is that we can keep our account information online so that we can use the platform over and over for future raffles, bidding or donation opportunities. I would highly recommend this service for any of your auction or online donation needs.","Cons: Sometimes when I was inputting text for an auction item the cursor popped back to the beginning of the paragraph. It was frustrating and slowed me down. However, when I reached out to the Accelevents team, they acknowledged the problem right away and confirmed they were working to fix it. This kind of a proactive response which takes ownership of the problem is very helpful, in my opinion.",Overall: Great overall experience. We hit our fundraising goals in our one week auction and our bidders really liked the online and mobile Accelevents experience.,

It is very clear how to set up your main page and then to add items, including names, photos, and descriptions as well as bidding information.","Cons: This was our second time using AccelEvents for our online auction. After our first auction, we made suggestions for areas that could be improved and all of those changes were implemented.","Overall: Besides the ease of use for the auction holder and bidders, there are a couple of additional benefits that you may not receive from another auction site. One of them being the CSR addresses any question or concern immediately. No matter what time or what day, any question you have will be instantly addressed. The other benefit is the cost. You will have an amazing auction site with a very affordable price tag. There are no hidden fees. You will know exactly what you will be paying to use the site.",

JUST WHEN YOU THINK you need to have this software needs a function that doesn't exist you ask CUST SUPPORT in a panic how in the world you will possibly make it work they are 5 million steps ahead of you. Not only that but within 5 seconds they reply with a warm stress free reply that reassures you that your event that you spent countless hours on is going to be the most amazing and successful event that could have possibly existed for your cause. I AM NOT A TECH SAVY PERSON! BORN IN THE MILLENNIAL GENERATION I STUCK AT COMPUTERS! but they have made it beyond easy! My second year happy to plan this even thanks to these guys!,Cons: the only thing i don't like about this software program is that they don't have the outreach that other auction softwares have that they send out technical help for the actual event to make the event smooth as possible. Even though they are there to help at every second through the site i can only imagine the absolute craziness if the top notch service was right in front of you,Overall: the amazing immediate reply with in 30 seconds of asking any question,

They have been great to work with and very quick to answer questions. We are a small nonprofit in a smaller market, so we appreciate their low cost, but feel their product is top shelf. Our (not tech savvy) patrons have found the platform easy to navigate, and love the addition of mobile bidding to our events. We recommend them to every who asks about our experience, and will continue to use them.",

Guests easily purchased tickets and bid on auction items. None required much help the night of our auction. I liked the ability to print out the description of all the auction items, get spreadsheets of the prizes and the winners. Tech support was invaluable both before and during the auction. The guys were just a chat away, which was important the night of our event since a few questions and issues came up where we needed help.","Cons: The software was limiting in that we sometimes have multiples of the same item. This required us to list the item numerous times rather than having the top couple of bidders win the item. Also, we had a wine pull and a fund-a-cause during the evening. Normally, we would keep track of who purchased the wine and who funded the cause and bill them at the end of the evening. With the Accelevent software, people would have to pay for the wine, fund-a-cause, and auction winnings in three separate transactions. We would have liked one simple end-of-the evening transaction/charge.","Overall: Simplified check-out process, easy access to bidders and winners, pdf file of all auction postings.",

Quick customer service when we had any question that needed answered, along with being understand and truly caring about help us find a solution, and not be over looked VERY AFFORDABLE!!","Cons: When in the Auction Table cannot organize items in alphabetical order, Bidder in the mobile app were getting confused when to put in there names and bid amount.",,

Very cost effective for our small NP with little money to spend

Phenomenal customer service

Ticketing was easy to set and we could customize per our specific needs. Silent Auction set-up, execution and checkout was the easy, straight forward and user friendly.

For the past couple of years, I have looked into solutions for moving our auctions online, in order to increase visibility and participation. But most of the solutions would cost us the bulk of our fundraising. For small community organizations like PTOs, the giant platforms are just not a viable solution.",,,,

This does not fall squarely on the shoulders of Accelevents as I am sure that much of it was operator error. If this service came in the form of an easy to use phone apps, it would be hands down the best product on the market!","Overall: Accelevent's has allowed our foundation to provide a hands-on experience to our silent auction supporters. Along with this, it enables us the ability to reach supporters who were unable to make the event, which has increased our funds raised exponentially.",

Most of our collaborative confidence, in the possibility of a successful fundraiser, in spite of my inexperience, came from the incredible 24/7 excellent AccelEvents support team.","Cons: An animated tutorial, walking me through all the steps might have helped to both lower my awkward beginner's fear-level of being so inexperienced, and also more rapidly increased my ability level. This might have helped me to reduce the number of questions I asked the awesome AccelEvents team, even though their team would still be needed.","Overall: Our collaborative fundraiser raised moneyfor each of 8 collaborators, with additional funds generated from offline purchases of paintings after the auction was over.",

The most absolutely consistent factor has been the customer service - they are awesome! They are always quick to reply and generally are able to help me find an easy solution. In terms of the program, it is easy to use and we have had interns and volunteers trained and using the program within minutes at our events. The look is clean and smooth, and the back-end interface is relatively intuitive and straight-forward. The cost is also perfect, especially for a small non-profit with a limited budget, as the low flat fee allows us to know our costs up-front and keep the majority of what we raise to put toward our mission.

Customer support is great--in chat or email with quick simple responses! Low cost--we raised $8000 and were able to keep most of it last year. Integration for payment was awesome!",Cons: We have multiple items in our auction that are the same (parking spots)--would be nice to list it on time and give the 3 spots to the 3 highest bidders. Small feature that's definitely not critical -- but a nice add on.,"Overall: We are an elementary school PTA that has a silent auction with 100 items once a year. Accelevents was perfect for us!

It has straightforward step by step instructions throughout the planning process and during the event itself.,"Cons: I would like to see them add a function where you can send messages to the users during the event to remind them to update their bids, etc.","Overall: We have used Accelevents for our past two PTO Silent Auctions.

I was able to make a nice looking event webpage. The cost was extremely reasonable. Accelevents is located in the Greater Boston area.","Cons: We had early bird ticket prices and later ticket prices, and I put the dates in, but it didn't switch over automatically; there was something I was supposed to do manually and didn't realize it. There were sample online auction items that never went away; only the users, not the visitors, could see them, but they were confusing and annoying. The limit to the number of contacts was too low.","Overall: We used Accelevents to create our Spring Bash webpage, which included an online auction. Accelevents is pretty easy to use, but it does have some confusing parts. Customer support makes Accelevents a standout.

We had the same the glitch the previous year. Customer service told me to hit the refresh button which did seem to work a bit before it would glitch again, in which case I would just hit refresh again.

This is saving us hours of work.",Cons: Not so thrilled with the initial look of the main page when our purchasers log on,Overall: I have had nothing but great experiences with Accelevents. I logged on one night around 10 PM and was having problems changing something. I chatted through the on line help and they continued to try to help me resolve my issue. ( I am sure it was more user error than software). The gentleman I was working with told me he would personally adjust what I was trying to do by the next evening.

Very easy to use to run auction event. And the customer service stands out. The team responded to every question quickly, many times within minutes of asking.

It was absolutely the most affordable, easiest and most enjoyable way to raise funds for student scholarships, travel fellowships and teacher grants. Our organization supports all students, but especially those with little or no means to access travel opportunities or to pay for college.

After looking at about 5-6 competitors, Accelevents seemed to be the most reasonably priced and easy to use software. A lot of other systems require a monthly subscription which is not reasonable for small organizations.","Cons: Some of the features are not completely obvious, and maybe the help articles could be a little more developed, but help was always available, prompt and patient.","Overall: Instead of cancelling a time consuming, expensive in-person auction, we moved to an online solution and saw a greater profit, with less work and less expenses.",

Ease of use

Responsiveness",,"Overall: When hosting our South African based charity event we didn't have a lot of options. After reaching out to a number of companies we managed to find Accelevents. Jon and Zach were accommodating, open to ideas, extremely responsive and customised the system to South African currency. It is also a cost-effective solution. Our online auction netted more than 34% extra revenue compared to the previous year's paper-based auction. The company has a bright future.",Recommendations to other buyers: Speak to the people from Accelevents - they are open to suggestions and have helped us customise the solution for our country.

Instead I was simply asked to provide my credit card info and directed to send a text submitting my 'tickets' I had just purchased to the items I wished to win. The whole process was quick, simple, and fun! Throughout the night I kept a close eye on the live tracker on the projection screen to see what items were getting the least amount of submissions. I could strategically submit my tickets from anywhere in the venue :) (rather than a packed raffle table with a line of other guests...). I ended up purchasing more tickets than I originally intended because there were no lines to wait in or tickets to fill out - and plus it was all for charity! I would definitely attend another event using AccelEvents and plan on proposing to the committees I sit on for future fundraising events.",,,,
4468,accelevents,Second time we've used Accelevents for our annual on-line auction. Extremely pleased.,Stu L.,vice-president,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,2018-06-05,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Appreciate the template for downloading auction items from a spreadsheet.

Event view is clear and easily distinguished between the opening and current bid.

On-line support was near instantaneous.

Will definitely continue to use in the future.","Cons: I wish Item Code could include numbers as well as letters, to make it easier to record multiple submissions from individual artists.",,

Everything was straightforward and self-explanatory.","Cons: It was a little frustrating that there were character limits when you download the catalog but not the item sheet, so in order to do everything we had to put in all of the short catalog descriptions, download that, and then delete the short put in the long descriptions for the sheets. It would've been helpful to have two text boxes, one for item sheet and one for catalog so that we didn't have to go back and forward. Also, there was no notice of these character limits so we didn't figure it out until we asked about. Clearer descriptions and additional text boxes would really help expedite the process.",,

Second would be the ease of bidders signing up and collecting their payments.,"Cons: We sell several expierences in our auction and last year we used the ticketing option which wasn't great for us so this year we put the expierences in the auction part, worked ok but still trying to figure out the best option for our expierences.",,

The system was extremely easy to use and we did not have any technical glitches. Our event was over 3 days and we needed a fair bidding system for everyone who attended. Accelerants was able to deliver and our offline (in between event days) bidding was 3x higher than during the events. It really helped boost sales. The developers are great guys and always responsive to any request or question we had, patiently walking us through steps whenever we needed guidance. I've already recommended them to several other organizations.","Recommendations to other buyers: I looked around for a long time, they are a great company.

It was partially user error as

I was in the middle of an event and the last thing I thought to do was call a customer service line, sit on hold for 20 minutes, and MAYBE get an answer. HOWEVER: The next day I sent a message to the chat service and CSR personally called me within about 1 minute of my chat request for a phone call. I have never experienced customer service like this. Now knowing the high level of customer service, I very well could have contacted him during my event and fixed my problem. Thank you Accelevents, and now I know!","Overall: This is a wonderful platform, very well designed, and exceptional for the price. The customer service is also top notch.",

Using their program is a fantastic alternative to asking your members to sell door to door, or to take raffle tickets with them to meetings, appointments and work. Everything is done electronically, so there is no counting or record-keeping on your part. CSR's seemed to be available 24/7 to answer questions. I am looking forward to using Accelevents for our Silent Auction in the spring.","Cons: Some of the stuff was a learning curve for me, but the Chat option is very helpful, and when I look back, it was actually very intuitive.",,

When running an auction it's nice to know that the guys are there to help you out whenever needed. I also like how cheap it is. Instead of spending thousands, I spent a certain amount to make my auction successful and fund needed. That is a steal!!!","Cons: I think that they need to add a live auction feature to the platform, but they said they are working on it.",,

Designing the set up was easy and quick. The dashboard was easy to use and intuitive. The analytics were helpful. Easy breezy.,"Cons: I wish the payment part has a camera to scan feature. Inputing the credit card info at an event might discourage people to not participate, as it take a while. I do like the new venmo payment feature though.",,

I was able to do a silent auction as well as sell raffle tickets. Payments were easy and I had no complaints from my attendees to our event regarding the process. I loved I could easily share on social media to get the word out on fundraiser. I did not utilize the ticket portion but would expect that would be smooth as well. Price was comparable to other products offered so I definitely made the right choice going with Accelevents!,Cons: I do not have anything bad to say here! Would highly recommend this product!,"Overall: Customer Service was great. When I had questions on functions or how my event was going to run, I got a response quickly and they were very easy to work with. I look forward to using Accelevents for my next fundraiser.",

Customer support via chat and email were on point...even during our event at 9pm at night they were there to answer questions.",Cons: No real issues with any details of software. All worked smoothly for the silent auction we had. Only suggestion is maybe consolidate the menus instead of having to click between so many to access different parts of the auction set up.,Overall: we were able to raise money by using this software for a silent auction. It was simple to tell people about how to bid and they were excited to keep getting text messages if they were outbid.,

The support was amazing from day one, considering I wasn't the most techie person and had a lot of questions, they were patient with me! Everything was online immediately with details of winning bidders, made check out a breeze. We wanted to broaden our reach outside of the actual live auction, and even had bidders from the UK and Australia!",Cons: Not really anything. The only thing that would be nice is to have a total if the winning bidder had more than one item.,"Overall: Ease of use from administrator to user. Our target radiance is older and not tech savvy, we had helpers and then the people started helping others, it's that easy.

The site was easy to set up and the technical support was outstanding (only one real technical issue that was quickly fixed - mostly it was me asking a lot of questions that Zach and team responded to quickly). The connection to Stripe worked quickly and easily. I did make my own small donation through the site because the first payment through Stripe takes about a week - subsequent payments only take a couple of days, so I had the auction winner's money in my organization's bank account within 48 hours. We used it for a single item that the donor wanted auctioned off immediately, but I'll definitely be looking to use Accelevents again for my annual event's silent auction.",

Then there were additional fees to avoid advertisements and post multiple pictures. I was about to give up when I came across AccelEvents. I cannot say enough about the ease of the program and amazing customer support...all for an incredibly fair price! I look forward to working with cust support team again for next year's fundraiser and plan to utilize all of their services, from ticket sales, to basket raffle tickets, to the silent auction again.",,,

Once we got started, we were impressed by their customer service, so helpful and timely. And even more impressed with the functionality. Such a great option and value for the investment!",Recommendations to other buyers: It would have been nice if we could have a silent auction where the top 3 bidders could win the item.

This option took care of BOTH of those and more for us. All I had to do was provide a picture and item description. Printable versions were easily available. Very easy to make changes.,"Cons: This is such a picky thing, but I do not like the ""Metro"" font on the website. Very difficult to see and when we projected the current bid screen it was not a good image for our bidders.",Overall: Earned more on our silent auction than ever before with much less effort,

The customer service was really good as well - we could just send a question through the chat and hear back within 5 minutes.

If you have a problem or a training issue they are nearly always available on the phone and if they can't help straight away they will look into it.,Cons: Reporting is probably Rollers biggest set back for us.

(There is however a patch in the works to integrate these down the line).,Overall: Roller makes the life simple for the customer and is constantly seeking to improve. They are receptive to feedback and will try to act on it within reason. They have improved as an operator over the time we have used them and continue to seek to offer more to the market opposed to becoming stagnant or ignoring glitches like other software providers we have previously used.,

If you don't write it down seperately people won't be annoyed by it. Also don't show the early tickets if they are sold out. Same reasons as above. People won't get a negative feeling about buying less cheap tickets.,Overall: Everything was very clear! Thanks :),

I love that they are open to feed back and take it seriously and work to make things better each year for the customers so the customers can make everyone happier such as the administrators, users, and registrants.","Cons: I wish we could upload photos more and add to any text areas instead of linking them. Also, wish we could create a seating or vendor layout that would be visual for the registrants where they could click on it to select a seat or a booth space they want to purchase. Additionally, created the option to have a 2 step process of registration involved where registrants can be approved first and then they can pay fee. We make this happen ourselves by manipulating the database for us and utilizing the code feature to unlock payments. But, it would be neat if when they applied or registered then administrators would run a report and then check a box beside all the registrants to approve and then it sends an approval email to them. This would make it simple instead of going into each of the 300 profiles and marking a custom field in their schedule. so many steps to approve someone. Each one takes like several screens. If there were any easier way to do this that would be amazing.",Overall: It really helps me to keep all of my registrants organized for different events. As well as my volunteer lists for events.,

If there are any items that need to be addressed, customer support is always excellent. The features they continue to add on are terrific.","Cons: There are some items I wish it had, but have not been developed yet such as a person being blocked from adding an invalid email. I also wish they would bring back the blocking emails from registering (maybe because the volunteer was not a right fit or they were banned for whatever reason). I also wish we would be able to download and/or contact all registrants in the system, not just by individual site. This would prevent some volunteers from receiving the same email (if they are registered for multiple sites) and would be less time for the administrator in sending out multiple emails for multiple sites.","Overall: We have been utilizing TRS for 5 years and the system keeps getting better. Customer support is outstanding and Customer support representative is an absolute joy to work with. They listen to suggestions and take into consideration items to improve on, though I know they are unable to accommodate all requests.","Recommendations to other buyers: I think, if they have not done so already, create a ""task force"" team to help create/develop new features based on the needs of the various organizations they work with. They could do a call every quarter or twice a year just to discuss trends and wish lists TRS may not have thought of."

The capabilities of the site seem very repetitive with adding shifts, customizing selections, etc, which makes building the site that much easier for me. The customer service with Flory and her team are top notch! They are always willing to answer questions and the follow up truly helps build the relationship with our team and theirs. Overall, I have had a very positive and great experience using the software!","Cons: Occasionally I run into the issue of the site not being as customizable for the event as it could be. For example, if I am running an event that only has one registrant type, it seems like there should be an option for users to go right to selecting activities. It is not horrible to not take this extra step of creating this one registrant type on the page, but seems that it could be more user friendly by having this be an option on the back end.",,

Not only is it simple and easy to get set up and manage, I have had some of the best customer service and working relationship with myTRS when working and managing sites.

5345,mytrs,Using TRS for client events,Mona F.,Owner,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,2013-02-28,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,8.0,,"Pros: User interface for constiuents and volunteers to register is simple and attractive. Custom field features allow me to create additional fields for management use that are not visible to registrants. The ease with which it exports to MS Excel makes it possible to quickly merge more elaborate letters, invoices, reports, etc. created in MS Word. Search/Advance Search function easy to use for building queries. Email function easy to use and allows for easy segmentation of database for communication.","Cons: Financial reports are a great resource for those needing basic information, but could be enhanced for those more engaged in financial managment of an event including reconciliation. Would like a new feature allowing reapplying payments when registrants change selected activities with the same or different prices. Despite lack of these advanced financial features for financial managers, I still rate TRS 5 stars in feature reachness because it meets or exceeds the registration features that most event managers need.","Overall: With nearly 25 years in nonprofit management and event management, this is the best product I have found for ease of use for event managers and registrants/volunteers, custom field flexibility, report flexibility, and more.",

Since the system is very user friendly, it's great to use at any size conference. It's easy to pull reports for registration. It's also great if the same registrants attend the same conference every year, as the system will keep the information and you can easily register each time.","Cons: Really nothing to complain about. There could be incomplete registrations if the registrant doesn't go till the end and unfortunately, the system doesn't show that their registration is incomplete. The registrant just doesn't receive the confirmation email to show them they are completely signed up.",,
5348,mytrs,From CLIENT to EMPLOYEE,Joelle B.,Account Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,2013-03-04,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,8.0,,"Pros: Before working at TRS, I was a client using the product. I was a Volunteer Manager for over 7000 volunteers and my first year we were using excel spreadsheets. TRS saved my life! I became efficient - knowing exactly who signed up for what shift, knowing where we were short volunteers, being able to track attendance, communicating with volunteers by event or shift because we actually got volunteers' email addresses!

Being able to actually pull reports before, during and after the event made me more effective as a volunteer manager.

Loved the 'include itinerary' option to always remind volunteers what they registered for!",Cons: Would like to see the reporting become more robust where you can set even more specific parameters and even pull some sort of a daily report of activity.,"Overall: TRS allowed me to actually start managing my volunteers and my volunteer program instead of being stuck behind a desk swamped with admin work. It also made me more organized and helped better our volunteer program changing the mindset from 'we desperately need volunteers' to 'if you want to volunteer with us, you have to follow these rules'. I believe so much in the product that when the opportunity arose, I started working for TRS!",

It is very easy to create the volunteer sites and customize everything to the event itself. I love the reports that are available as well.,"Cons: It would be nice to have people use the same email address if they are in the same family. I have had quite a few people call and ask if they need to create a different email for themselves to sign up. Also, the activities are expanded underneath the activity groups so that might be nice to have not expanded. It takes a while to create an activity in the activity maker, it is much easier to do it in excel. Maybe instead of choose the month and day you could type it in instead?",Overall: Quick and easy registration site.,

It would be nice to be able to send test emails or save drafts and come back to an email later. There is also a problem with the formatting of our banner when an email is sent. We have followed the size specifications but the image is distorted when it is sent.,"Overall: Working with the TRS product has been very positive for our organization. Most importantly they continue to make changes and updates that benefit the end user. As with anything, there is room for improvement but the overall product is very good and cost effective.","Recommendations to other buyers: Simplifying the group sign-up feature would be helpful.

It was required by the Convention to use this program and I can understand why because it was so easy to maintain so many volunteer shifts with so many volunteers (20+ different volunteer jobs and around 200 volunteers, each year!).

From the beginning, the customer support was amazing, whenever I needed help with something I got immediate response.

It's extremely easy to learn how to use the system and it's very easy for your patrons as well. It's also great for repeat events since you can duplicate the site from year to year.

We had several attendees who were following their confirmation email but the printed final schedule at the registration desk may have only included one of their actual classes and not the new or updated schedule.

She answers every questions I have and is able to help me through any issue I have while using the website. I would have an email response with 24 hours, and am able to call with any questions I may have to get a more thorough response. Despite the difficulty of learning how to navigate the website, I would recommend TRS to anyone, especially those with a large volunteer base.

It has jumped us into the 21st century by allowing us to offer online ticket sales! Wintix has enabled us to streamline the way we store all of our box office information and has eliminated the need for other software programs that we had been using to track our sales (Quicken, primarily), keep customer records and print tickets. We have been able to customize the program to our unique situation of selling flex season passes where passholders then reserve seats for each performance individually. We have a small house of 166 seats, but this software has made our job so much easier and less time consuming in handling tickets, payments, reservations, etc. The tech support is wonderful and has been so beneficial to a box office manager that is just tech savvy enough to by... yet has been able to make the switch without any trouble! OK, well I've made a couple of panicked phone calls, ha, ha.

We have 2500 season subscribers and 2000-2500 single ticket buyers per show.

You simply set up a show to be any category of receipts such as tuition, show deposit refunds, liquor concessions. For non-show events we use the option to not use a seating chart. It's also great for Flex Pass season subscriptions where patrons don't use a series such as 3rd Friday of each show.

In this time we have made many requests for specific options in the software. Bruce, Diane, Peggy and Twila always listen to the needs of our facility and what we think our customers are requesting. Center Stage Software has customized reports, helped us with fan club sales and patiently helped us through our busy, crazy moments of selling tickets. Their professionalism, understanding of the market place and building/customer relationships is outstanding. The flexibility of web ticketing to printing hard tickets for volunteers to sell and the price for this service is beyond compare. I recommend Center Stage Software highly.",Pros: Ease of use- this was the first ticketing software I ever used and it was great to learn on,Cons: I think it could look better. My only complaint would really be aesthetics,"Overall: Our company made the scary choice to move into Wintix 6/Webtix some time ago. Within no time at all we knew we made the best choice and the web orders came flowing into Wintix 6 with virtually no effort from our staff.

- Easy to add packages, products and donations to the offerings

- Easy to set up numerous shows and events throughout the year and share access to box office information to select individuals for select productions

- Ability to track all donor activity, including donations, attendance at shows, and product purchases (such as Auction wins or merchandise sales)

- Ability to sort donors by category or campaign

- Ability to have multiple donor campaigns for multiple projects

- The online format allows our Development Staff to work remotely when necessary because all donor information is on the cloud","Cons: The ability to track pledges and offset them with donations is still in development. We'd like to be able to track a donation for its intended fiscal year, but that feature is not currently available. It would also be nice to be able to track Grant Deadlines and activity, as one can do with some of the more expensive programs.","Overall: We've been using OvationTix since its inception. With dozens of shows throughout the year, including many for which we function purely as Presenters, the functionality of OvationTix has been crucial to our success. Our presented productions can monitor and see the success of their shows, and we can manage the overall process.

Integration with Email and Website Platforms

Great Support

Helpful and Ongoing Upgrades

Call Center for Ticket Buyers by Phone

Private, Custom Branding

No Up-Front Cost: we only pay OvationTix when we sell tickets.","Cons: We aren't a non-profit company, so all the fundraising features in the solution don't really apply to us. This is not a complaint really, but those tools are probably of great use to other companies. We just don't use them.","Overall: Our events perform in multiple venues with varying set-ups: assigned seats, general admission, and with various types of tickets like VIPs and student pricing in venues from 99 seats up to 800 or more seats. We also use discount codes, want something that easily integrates with email software and our website and really responsive support since we produce more events than our relatively small staff can handle! OvationTix has worked very well for us in this first six months of our partnership with them. I like that they update the software monthly with new features. It is important our company keep its branding consistent and OvationTix makes that process seamless.","Recommendations to other buyers: Get trained on the software! It is really intuitive anyway, but training is free and you can get a lot more out of it early on if you and your staff get formally trained. It's all by phone/webinar and easy."

It is also flexible, so we can adjust it to our needs as an itinerant company. We can make our subscriptions customizable to each space that we are in.",Cons: The reporting function is not as straightforward as I would like. Sometimes it takes some extra finesse and creativity to pull a report with the exact information that you need. It is not as straightforward as a database as it is a ticketing software.,"Overall: Overall, Ovationtix is very easy to use and client friendly. They have a great support team that is easy to reach and very helpful. For a small company such as ours that does not have a stationary box office, their phone line is a great way for us to offer box office service to our patrons. It's online functionality, allowing us to use anywhere we go, is great, as we are an itinerant theater company, and need to set up a new box office area for each show, somethimes in areas that are not as conducive to a theater environment.","Recommendations to other buyers: Love ovationtix.

There are so many useful features, it can feel a bit cluttered, but once one learns the process, it handles every aspect of selling. The API is nice for embedding on your own site.","Cons: The entire process - from setup to event management to the API - is centered around multiple performances of one run (show), as per a traditional theater. Setting up one-off shows and shows that run continuously is much more of a burden to maintain. Ad-hoc shows, especially, require that you set up a completely new event, including reminder emails, ticket setup, etc. even if that info doesn't change from show to show.","Overall: The system is reliable and solid in what it does. Support does their best to help you find workarounds for non-traditional theaters, but are unwilling to consider enhancement requests without paying for the development. My one actual technical issue (notifications of credit card failure self-dismissed to quickly for the user to read) has been pretty much ignored.",

After evaluating numerous Solutions, but ease-of-use during set up all the way through the user experience has been a game changer for us. We went from selling 80% of our tickets In person or at the door to selling 95% of our tickets online. This helps us forecast revenue, understand the number of volunteers we will need at events, And communicate easily with our ticket buyers before and after events. Our ticket sales have increased dramatically over the past two years","Cons: After selling well over 30,000 tickets a year the number of complaints from users or ticket buyers have been able to be counted on two hands. Usually the complaint is that they don't know how to scroll down to put the tickets in the cart. That has literally been the only complaint and it happened about 10 times.","Overall: We aren't entirely volunteer Ronn community theater organization. Our board, members, and patrons range in age from five years old to 90 years old.

The team at VBO has responded to ALL requests. One example: Several CaribTix clients use physical thermal tickets so we offer the service in addition to online ticketing, VBO was able to facilitate the import of printed thermal tickets so both physical and online tickets reside in the same database. Additionally, VBO was able to design an app to facilitate the sales, statistics and validation of all tickets online or offline. This has allowed us to provide a Closed Loop Solution for our clients.",Recommendations to other buyers: Design a simpler UI

It manages much more than just ticket sales - our membership program with four levels, comp tickets for our cast and crew, merchandise sales, discount prices for our members, emails to members when their memberships are going to expire and lots more.","Cons: It is fairly expensive, but we have the cost added to the ticket prices as a fee. Most buyers are used to such fees and do not complain. It is fairly complex, so it is difficult to keep our box office volunteers trained to use all its functions.","Overall: Ticket sales are a breeze.

There are some things that our staff would like to see to help make things easier so it's up to us to let VBO know.,"Overall: We use VBO for almost all our class registrations as well as our home season ticketed concert. The support team has been supporting us from the very beginning:

- Listening and implementing our suggestions to make the tool work for our needs.

- Always available when we need to reach them.

- Their overall passion for serving the arts community and making their product better.",Recommendations to other buyers: We can't recommend them enough for other organizations that are looking for a convenient and affordable way to enhance and simplify their box office needs.

On line and hand held user friendliness.,Cons: The report structure. We need to be able to report in a more direct fashion instead of making due.,"Overall: We recently switched to VBO following an extended agreement with a different box office software company. The customer service features of VBO are unsurpassed. We are thrilled with the experience we are able to offer our patrons. What we are having issues with currently is the promise of a report that will help with all of our needs. We, or course, understand that all things take time and that everything good is worth waiting for. Unfortunately, we have had to make due with a hunt and peck method of reporting to both our business office and and marketing department for sales data. It is there, but it is currently far from user friendly. The staff at VBO continues to be extremely helpful in helping us find solutions to our problems, but it is not the panacea that we were hoping for. Perhaps a Christmas present of the new report is on the horizon so that the internal users can also experience the expediency that our patrons are witnessing. I still strongly recommend VBO to anyone who is interested in a box office system. I will give it an even stronger recommendation once the new report is available. Keep going, guys! The finish line must be close.",

The best part about this company however is that if there is ever something that we needed that is not already integrated into the system their fantastic customer service agents immediately get to work getting it to work for us.

Newsletter features were very nil.,"Overall: If you are not computer savvy, learning VBO can be a bit daunting, but the customer service team is excellent. Each time I call them with a question, I talk to a real person who is helpful and kind. VBO is really good for tracking information and allows you to alter your ticketing info and events with ease. The mailing system for customers is OK, but they work well with other institutions such as Mailchimp to make e-newsletters a cinch. Creating pricing deals for customers is also quick and easy to do.",

We especially like the fact that their ticketing pages are embedded into our web pages so the customer sees a seamless site from start to finish. They are continually making upgrades to all areas of the software which mean they're constantly improving. Their reporting features are not as intuitive or malleable as we'd like. It would be great for them to add a custom reporting center where the client can build their own reports based on specified criteria. Hope they do that soon!,,,,

VBO staff were able to get us up and running in under two weeks, which was AMAZING. (Although I wouldn't recommend that timeline to anyone -- but they can do it!) The software is very user friendly to our patrons who had no trouble moving to a new user experience, and from the back end, with very little training, our entire staff was able to sell tickets over the phone successfully. The back end reporting does need a little help, but the company has worked hard over the last year to improve the functionality, and I am pleased with what the software is able to do now for us with regard to sales reports and data. Overall, I think it's a great ticketing / subscription / member software for the price and staff support. We researched five other CRM systems this fall and ended up sticking with VBO. I would highly suggest a demo with the company to see if it fits into what you need. And if you're not sure, they seem willing to customize the process so it works for you. Would be great for museums, theater companies, symphonies, ballets, operas, who operate year round, but also for music festivals, etc that need it on the occasional basis.",,,,

From our first contact with the company to setting up the site and linking it to our own website, to brilliant customer service and support, to well...everything. We have had a great experience. Additionally, my assistant has given me extremely positive feedback about all of her interactions with VBO Tickets and has relayed to me that the response time for addressing any of her questions has been incredible, so much so that she told another community theater company about our experience. Because of our experience, they too are excited about building a new partnership with VBO Tickets. Thank you very much for everything that you have done for us. We look forward to our continued partnership and growth with VBO Tickets!",Recommendations to other buyers: None that I can think of at the moment. Please keep up the terrific work!

When we discovered, we were not aware just how amazing they would be at customizing our experience for our small theatre. The customer service ALONE is worth the cost of use.

It has allowed us to move our service up another level, and to rely less on one person (me) so that I can envision passing the ticketing/membership function on to someone else. The only suggestion I would make is that structure is needed in the overall training program. I am now at the point where I am wrestling with reconciling sales in VBO/Stripe/my bank account/chart of accounts and it is very difficult and non-uniform. Key information that I need (what was purchased - a subscription or tickets, and tickets to what event) are not passed over into Stripe, so I have to do a cumber reconcile process in order to allocate a deposit among the various bookkeeping accounts. I would suggest a chat feature. Stripe has it and it has really helped when I have questions.",,,,

The discount flexibility helps us out a lot, and VBO even built the ability to authorize, but not charge cards until we review the transaction - allowing our fans to change their orders up until the day of show.

Support staff has been very responsive. Having the system has cleaned up a lot of previous human error as we took reservations on handwritten forms for the prior TWENTY NINE years. With VoIP phones and this cloud based ticketing system we have the ability to allow BO staff to work form home when needed - answering phones and making reservations as if they were sitting in the office.","Cons: Subscribers with flexible packages can not go online to make individual show reservations. That is very unfortunate for us with over 5,000 subscribers in non-traditional subscription packages. Reporting take a bit of time to get used to. We are still double checking each other's list pulls to be confident they are correct. I also find there are some traditionally standard BO operations that can't be done, which frustrates me. I don't think the system should dictate how we do business. I suggest you appoint or hire a systems administrator as your go to person on staff. They'll have a lot to learn, program and continue to maintain. Our Audience Services Manager dedicates, on average, 8 hours a week to system administration.","Overall: Increased sales. Online sales capabilities. Less human error in making reservations and a quick ""checks and balances"" with confirmation emails. No surprises at curtain of patrons being booked into the wrong night. Faster reservation making because there is no more handwriting. Much more accurate sales reporting. Sales that tie into our accounting figures.",

The CRM aspect is important and of course useful, but the most impactful part of the program for our organization is reporting. We would not be able to effectively run our business without the many reporting options available in this program. We can compare sales year over year, create campaigns for marketing and development, and so on. All layers of the database including ticket sales and donations speak to each other so we can pull reports for almost anything. Not to mention, if I do not know how to do something the support team will assist me. My background is customer service and the Patron Manager team exceed my expectations. They are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. They are great teachers. I also like how this program is customizable. There are tons of additional applications (some paid, mostly free) that can be added to PatronManager. These additional applications are very helpful. I recently downloaded one that will allow me to manage our volunteer program. Its truly a lifesaver.","Cons: One con is the response time for support. We do have the ability to mark the urgency of a support request, and they will respond immediately for urgent requests, but it would be nice to get a quicker response for even non urgent matters. Sometimes the little issues are still a big deal.",Overall: It has facilitated significant growth in ticket sales and fundraising by making it possible for us to have a 360 degree view of everyone in our database.,

Ease of reporting, either using pre-made reports that come built in, or by customizing our own for specific details. Features are constantly being added - a highlight of any month is reading through Release Notes! Because my department is so small, I have come to depend on PM to house institutional knowledge that would otherwise be lost if even one member of our team left the organization. Building and managing inventory could not be easier. Love that I can customize email templates - has made invoicing directly from PM so easy. Chatter makes communicating with our student staff a breeze, and I love that I am able to work from home using PatronManager when weather or school closings are an issue. Have wifi, will travel.","Cons: There definitely has to be someone on staff who can be an admin that is well versed in most of the smaller troubleshooting issues, so that you're not constantly relying on PM Support. However, the online training and help modules are so robust, that this is not a problem. There is always help available, either online, or through the fantastic client services department that handles support requests.",Overall: It has facilitated significant growth in ticket sales and fundraising by making it possible for us to have a 360 degree view of everyone in our database.,
5576,patronmanager,"Using PatronManager has allowed us to integrate everything we do, despite having no central office.",Verified Reviewer,,Entertainment,Source: Capterra,NO,,2018-01-11,5,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,,"Pros: Truly an integrated CRM system that allows us to see what our members and non-members are doing. All-volunteer organization has some unique processes, and we have been able to customize PatronManager to accommodate our show attendance invitation system, for example. Also, because it's cloud-based and, once set up, most user procedures are fairly straight-forward, we've been able to decentralize a number of data management tasks. Committees manage their own data, rather than one database administrator (also volunteer) needing to be responsible for all collection and reporting. We also like the ability to clone donation forms (non-complex ones) ourselves, to customize them for specific purposes.","Cons: Developing reports is more challenging than many of our members can handle technically, so that remains largely the purview of a very small number of people (1-2). Implementation was generally smooth, despite some (inevitable) resistance to change. If there are multiple people qualifying donations and ticket orders, that process needs to be actively managed. Without active management, qualification can get a back-log, which (appropriately) results in temporary dupes in the system.",Overall: It has facilitated significant growth in ticket sales and fundraising by making it possible for us to have a 360 degree view of everyone in our database.,
5577,patronmanager,Very robust CRM system perfect for Non-Profit Theatre Company,Keith R.,General Manager,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,2018-01-10,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,"Pros: Patron Manager stores all of our ticketing and donor data in a single database which allows us to create reports and mailing lists from a single source rather than pulling records from multiple excel spreadsheets. Their customer service and online help is world class, and keeps getting better each year with additional webinars and added content. Their process for keeping the database 'clean' is very helpful and avoids the duplication of records. The product is stable. Downtime is almost non-existent - we've had perhaps 3 incidents over 5 years of not being able to access the database and even then it was for a very short period of time with minor-to-no impact to operations.","Cons: The only 'negative' about the product was during our initial setup. The ease of data import was over-hyped. Templates were provided but the brunt of the work had to be done by us. This was five years ago and I'm going to guess they have found processes to make it easier for their customers to import data. All of this said, once they received the templates populated with our data the database was set up correctly.",Overall: It has facilitated significant growth in ticket sales and fundraising by making it possible for us to have a 360 degree view of everyone in our database.,

We are so glad that we chose Patron Manager and Salesforce. It is truly a system that will grow as our organization grows (and it is helping us in that growth!). We now have access to information and data in ways that were not possible with our previous systems. The support team has been very helpful in solving problems and guiding us in different directions as we test the limits of what we want to do. Our team is fired up to utilize Patron Manager and Salesforce and are eager to learn more.,"Cons: Reporting can be a bit of a challenge as it requires some very specific thinking about how to find what you want to know. Even after using the product for several years, I still feel like I'm not fluent in reporting.",Overall: Easier access to data about our patrons. We can now make better fact-based data decisions rather than relying upon hunch.,

Not only are the functions laid out in an easy-to-use, organized fashion, but the visual aesthetic of the program itself makes it almost self-explanatory. And if you have any questions, simply visit the PatronManager Help tab, where you can find step-by-step how-to's on almost any PatronManager feature or ""Submit a Support Request.""","Cons: Although the ""Reports"" feature is quite robust, especially along with CRM Snapshot options, but the sorting ""Fields"" are not available for every report. (Work-arounds usually do the trick.)","Overall: Again, not only is it easy to use and nice to look at from a user perspective, but it also allows for remote access, which helps make it THE BEST ticketing software I've ever had the pleasure of using in all of my 10+ box office sales experience!",

We implemented nearly four years ago now, and we have very much enjoyed continuing to grow with them. PM got us that much closer to a true 360-degree view of our patrons, donors, alumni, students, parents, listeners, employees, and volunteers. Plus, it's on the Salesforce platform which means it's secure, fast, and reliable, as well as scalable and configurable.","Cons: Honestly, there's not much to dislike. There are a few minor aspects that I wish were more configurable for our environment, but we have workarounds for them so not a large negative impact.","Overall: Again, not only is it easy to use and nice to look at from a user perspective, but it also allows for remote access, which helps make it THE BEST ticketing software I've ever had the pleasure of using in all of my 10+ box office sales experience!",

PatronManager has been able to help us do more and is very customize-able. CRM snapshots (easy way to run quick list like show me ticket buyers that came to X show but not bought tickets for Y show yet).",Cons: There is a learning curve in creating your own customized reports as the reporting structure is very robust. The payoff is worth the learning curve as you can create reports on just about anything.

You can look at a person's PatronManager account and really see a snapshot of that patron's interactions with the Ballet...from their last ticket order to their recent meeting with the development team. So helpful, especially for our small staff!","Cons: Because the possibilities in Salesforce are so vast, things can be overwhelming upon first adoption for non-tech-minded people.

If the software doesn't have what you need out of the box, they will build something custom for you (or you can build it yourself!) and they're always updating the software with new features to improve ease of use or give more powerful options.",Cons: You really do need an admin on the staff who will be in charge of maintaining the software from your side. That staff person should learn as much about the software as they can to troubleshoot minor problems in-house so you won't need their support system for small things.,Overall: We've seen immediate increases of both ticket sales AND donation revenue.,

The program holds all customer data and is organized by contacts, households, etc. Users can easily search by any aspect of the customer account (name, email, phone, etc). The multiple reporting features are also very useful.","Cons: It is extremely frustrating that there is not an option to automatically connect online orders to an existing account. Instead, all orders must be qualified on the backend, which is an astoundingly time consuming and mundane process. For such a popular system, it is surprising that this issue persists. Additionally, the ticket sales function is not very user friendly and is extremely slow to complete. Each transaction requires multiple pages, and the web browser automatically reloads whenever a selection is changed. In addition, email addresses are required to make a sale, and the only way to get around this is very clunky and time consuming.",Overall: It is a great way to store all customer data in a comprehensive CRM.,

5606,online box office system,168tickets is the choice,Alexander S.,Artistic and Managing Director,,,,Source: Capterra,2010-04-12,4,5.0,,5.0,,,,"Pros: + inexpensive system

+ simple with lots of features

+ perfectly flexible and adjustable for the different needs

+ very helpful and qualified staff

+ nice people to work with

+ amazingly quick responses on our requests

+ very personal work relationship",Cons: We have not experienced any yet.,"Overall: We had been investigating new ticketing systems for quite a while, and 168tickets was one of the companies we took a closer look at.

The reasons we chose their product were because their offer was kept simple, easy to understand and very inexpensive.

What they offer is great and fits our needs perfectly: from single tickets to full season passes with different pricing per event, ticket printing at home and other features which will help our office staff tremendously. What absolutely convinced me was their incredibly short response time to our requests during the set-up period, and how helpful they were in assisting us to get everything up and running. I don't think any other company could have done any better, so I highly recommend 168tickets from our experience so far. Also, every time you call or email, you deal with the same person which means you don't have to explain your problem over and over again.",

I can train new staff to do a sale, exchange, and refund within an hour. We have over 75,000 patrons per year, over 1000 performances and hundreds of different producers. We also produce our own festivals and programming and most other festivals in our 4 theatre complex. With this variety, we need a system that was flexible and works well with our eyes and.. attitude toward requests from our tenants. Vendini is approachable and focused on making the product work for us. They create a very personal connection to their customers and their support. I can be in touch several times a month trying to accommodate a request from one of our tenants, be it a certain type of reporting, or a membership/package they want to offer. I take these to my rep who works with the appropriate team to accommodate our needs. They have helped me create several specialized reports that give specific producers exactly what they want. They have helped me create seating venues that accommodate special pricing, sections, levels etc. . They have shown me useful ways to use memberships and fees. There have been many upgrades the past couple years, Email Marketing, reporting, ticket agent and patron manager. It's great to work with a company that listens to customers. Great possibilities!","Cons: The software is great, but of course not perfect. It can take time and some trial and error to get reports created how you want them. I feel there could still be work to do in this area. Support area is terrific and helpful, especially with urgent/time sensitive requests, but can take a bit longer when it is not priority. I think this is because they take time to find the right team, to give the best answer to solve the issue.",,

It offers you the ability to combine your patron databases into one centralized location and then build the database automatically as your attendance increases. You can then use this information for email marketing (a similar system and set up to Constant Contact but I think more intuitive), direct mailings and patron management (such as the scheduling of development activities). The ability to review patron history is invaluable. And you can customize the tagging and grouping of patrons to suit your needs. Additionally, the software provided a website solution for us.",,"Overall: It has changed the way we do business. I can directly attribute our success in the recent years to our implementation of this program. It decreased workload, increased quality of output and made our patrons stand-up and take notice. Vendini continues to make upgrades to areas of the system. They recently added a patron database management section with basic development tools like the ability to schedule calls or tasks. And their email marketing recently got a facelift. So some of my biggest concerns are being addressed.",

By the time someone has typed a donation letter, I've already processed payment and printed the tickets. It is, hands down, the best ticket system for managing not only the ticket sales, but the relationship with the customer. Yeah, I could do a one-time ticket sale with EventBrite or BrownPaper Tickets (whatever they're called), but I don't have a long running capture of deep customer spending and attendance history.","Cons: The only thing that we ran up against was that pew style seating is hard to section off in the software and, inevitably, it was easier to create general ""rooms"" for reserved sections rather than using the seating chart for a church sanctuary. It's wonderful for theater seating!",,

You are able to use your website and logo as well as the logo of the band or event you are selling tickets for. My favorite option is the ability to add a donation to individual's purchases. I worked with a Foundation that was raising funds for scholarships. Being able to add an additional donation button gave me the opportunity to earn additional funds for my Foundation. In addition, I loved the marketing portion. To be able to send an email to patrons through vendini instead of constant contact was super easy.",Cons: The function that I liked the least was that you are limited to character usage and design when it comes to marketing your events.

Our ticket sales have increased significantly since using Vendini, and season ticket subscribers increased from 10 to 45 in one year. Our fundraising has increased too as patrons easily add tip jar donations to each ticket purchase.

Professional appearance",Cons: Wish I had more hours in the day to utilize all the features of the program.,"Overall: I have been using Vendini now for over 7 years. The system is used across our Performing Arts Department at a large urban high school. I do not have a staff other than the students in the class. This is what is so wonderful about Vendini, it can do a little or it can do a lot. The students who are trained on the program are learning industry standard Arts Management skills. It goes well beyond just ticketing but also incorporates easily social media such as email and Facebook. Since using the program our shows sell out, revenue is way up, and we are able to have an impressive professional face. I cannot say enough good things about the services the program offers. In fact, it has been so successful that our district, the second largest in California, is taking it district wide based on the success and recommendations from my site.",Recommendations to other buyers: It will change how you market your shows! It will make ticket sales exciting for you and your staff. The reports features and ability to use the program on tablets and phones will have you checking sales in the middle of the night just for fun :-)

The email functionality needs to be updated as well--not terribly modern looking emails, and the functionality is a bit buggy.","Overall: Helped us sell more tickets by giving us online ticket sales, email marketing, reporting and patron management all in one package.",

-Great customer service: Vendini has an incredible response time to any support request.

-Constantly improving: When we asked for a new feature they added us to a list of people that requested the same feature and not long after we were in the beta testing group.

-Donor information and tracking is robust for small to midsize organizations: We have a small team and we have barely scratched the surface of the donor and patron information",Cons: -Mobile version of the seating chart can be cumbersome and could scale better (I would add that we haven't received any complaints but that is our offices' opinion).,,

Keeping various patron bases is extremely helpful Being able to look at sales based on single ticket sales or subscriptions is very important. Being able to send marketing emails is a terrific asset.,"Cons: I am not thrilled with the relatively new (appx one year) layout of the events page for a particular event. Have to open multiple windows to get all of the information, such as total sales. In the past, that was all on one screen. The email marketing has improved but would love for it to be even more like a ""constant contact"" program where you could easily import photos and drag and drop various elements.

I wish we had advisories about that.,"Overall: I've been using Vendini ticketing software for eight years and have trained countless numbers of students at my University Box Office how to use the software in a quick amount of time. As our staffing changes each semester, and our events can change on a dime, the ability to train quickly, make changes instantly, and have flexible software that is easy to use, is imperative. I created some great relationships with the Vendini support team so that when there is an occasional hiccup, I know who to call and receive courteous and helpful service. But perhaps the most important aspect of Vendini is that it gets the job done. Not everything has to be complicated, and Vendini isn't!","Recommendations to other buyers: For a box office that has rotating staff that don't have the time to make operating ticketing software their first priority, this is a great option. I can teach someone to use Vendini at the window in five minutes to get us through a busy show. Then, teaching the more intricate levels of reporting, exchanges etc. is easy to build on. I have a student staff of 30 and often many of them change each semester based on their school schedules. Ease of use and success at accomplishing the task are my main priorities and Vendini accomplishes both. It is also affordable!"
5631,vendini,Confident all in one ticketing/marketing solution both you and your venue can grow with,Russell T.,Box Office Manager & Event Coordinator,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2015-03-23,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,9.0,"Comments: We've been using Vendini since June 2011. One of the major reasons we switched ticketing providers was for ease of use. Our box office is staffed by a rotating group of students who need to be trained in a relatively short period of time. Vendini's POS TicketAgent is pretty self explanatory and my students are able to pick it up almost immediately. On the backend, building events the way we need them is a breeze and it almost seems like the reporting capabilities are limitless. It really makes my job easier by improving the flow of information to our marketing team and development office. As far as peripherals are concerned, Vendini is really ""with it"" in terms of functionality and integration. Our box office was able to upgrade to cash draws that electronically integrate with the POS and we added iPads & iPods so that we could offer print-at-home and mobile tickets. The apps developed to work with these devices are really cool and really easy to use. We get compliments from our customers all the time when we scan their ticket on an iPod or sell them tickets an iPad. I feel really confident knowing that they continue to program new tools and update existing ones to help make event ticketing simpler for venues like mine. What's also really helpful is that they have excellent training and continued learning opportunities through a comprehensive online support catalogue (including both written & video tutorials). It's a great resource. In addition, they host an annual Vendini Member Conference where you can network with system experts and other venues using their solution. It's an invaluable experience to learn more about their solution and how to get the most out of it. In terms of customer service, Vendini has been open to our feedback and responsive to all our requests and has always found a solution for any problems that we have experienced.",,,,

I had very little training and had to hit the ground running -- and I was anxious about messing it up. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it is really very intuitive and smooth. We have an older patron base who had been used to buying their tickets by mail or personally on the phone; I was concerned that they might not adapt too well. Lo and behold, it is less than a year and online sales account for almost 60% of total sales with almost no complaints. A real tribute!",Cons: This is hard to say. I can't really come up with anything.,"Overall: The most important aspect of working with Vendini has been the support team. To a person, they have been terrifically responsive, patient, and CLEAR in their directions. The patience is amazing!

I don't know where they get their team members, but the selections are superlative. If you are trying to decide between Vendini and another service, go with Vendini.",

We tried a few during that time frame that just didn't work well enough to suit our needs. I stumbled upon Vendini at an INTIX conference and instantly fell in love. The software has done exactly what I need AND the developers LISTEN to my needs and have actually improved the software based on our requests. They answer the phone when I have problems and FIX it, right away (there has only been a need for this a few times in over 4 years). The additions and features with all the available reports have made my job so much easier. We are more efficient in our marketing efforts (which has saved us a ton of money) due to the reports that tell us where our customers are coming from. The website that is attached to the software makes it a snap to always have the most up to date information on the web for our customers (which in turn has cut down on the number of phone calls from customers because they can easily find that info about us on our website now)

Try it... (I don't work for Vendini)... The day you sign up will be a very happy day. Your job will become so much easier, efficient and FUN. Plus Vendini has Camp Vendini every year where you can go and learn more about the functions of the software, learn about business in general and have some good old fashioned FUN networking with others from the same industry.

I recommend Vendini 100%",,,,

Other times, guests have reported not being able to be sure they actually had their order processed. From a technical backend perspective, there are just no options. I went to WIX and could design a website much easier with a ticketing option that looked 1000x better. The problem is that the theater company I am helping wants to use this cause it is all they know. There are no templates for website design (which how do you not have this - its 2018 - not 2004??) This just seems like a platform built in the mid 2000s that was never improved upon.

The staff is so helpful and quick with any needs you have.

The report section of ticket sales is very helpful to us and we use it on a daily basis.

One other thing that was very helpful to us was the fact that Showclix was able to send out an email blast to all our previous customers announcing new shows. Great Networking!

And of course Josh is the best!","Cons: Some clients have complained about the time they have to purchase tickets. It seems that they have been kicked out of the system if they do not make their purchase in a set amount of time.

I personally think there is ample time to make a selection and purchase tickets.",Overall: I feel Showclix ticketing system is top notch. I would recommend it to anyone who is holding an event and would like to track their sales.,

ShowClix featured our brand so well on our ticketing page, that customers thought that the ticketing page was part of our site. The setup was complete, with design elements in place, in no time at all.","Cons: Our ticketing process was a bit rushed, given circumstances on our end. As such, training on the system that will surely help optimized working with the features available, wasn't something we paid much attention to mastering. This isn't as much a con as it is an opportunity to incorporate in the future with other events.","Overall: ShowClix is a wonderful partner for giving an event more punch, personality and customization.

5698,giveffect,The best fundraising software available!,Stephanie S.,Chief Development Officer,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,2017-04-18,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,10.0,,"Pros: It's so easy to use. The capacity of this software improves about every 2 weeks when they release a new update to the system. It's grown exponentially since we started using it about 2 years ago. They now provide amazing resources: training video tutorials, webinars, a Facebook group page to network with other users, etc. They just keep upgrading the system and adding new features so regularly, I truly believe Giveffect can literally do anything you need it to.","Cons: Nothing really. The only downside for us is the price. Honestly the price is a great value for what you get, it's just a little high for smaller non-profits...but you can literally do everything you need to.","Overall: Before Giveffect, we were using BlackBaud Raiser's Edge, and no one in our office could use it well. Just to learn how to use it, our employees had to pay a large fee and go to a week long training seminar. It was not convenient, and that knowledge was lost as employees turned over. I managed to figure out how to use it myself, but wasted a lot of time. Training others on my team was next to impossible. During the initial demo, we could tell that Giveffect was leaps and bounds ahead of Raiser's Edge. With Giveffect, the software itself is very intuitive, and the provided free training video tutorials and webinars are really helpful. Even before those resources were available, it was so easy for me to just start using the system. I've since been able to set up my entire team using the system, and they've had few to no difficulties learning to use it. Our focus is now on building better relationships with our donors rather than fighting with a system to enter gift information. Giveffect has been absolutely wonderful for our team.","Recommendations to other buyers: It has so much potential. The integration with other services is really nice, i.e. mail chimp for email marketing. They've recently added auction software, you sell event tickets, donate button on your website, volunteer management, literally everything you need."

The time savings for our staff has been huge! Also, the ongoing training opportunities, customer support and ever evolving aspects have been incredibly helpful and have allowed us to make our processes even more efficient. The software is also very intuitive and easy to use/understand. In addition, the team at Giveffect actually listens and evolves the software based on the growing needs of users and the clients we serve.",Cons: I have yet to have a negative thought about Giveffect.,"Overall: ""By switching to Giveffect we have eliminated having to use multiple platforms to function. Everything was separate for us before and we basically were spending a ton of time moving between software, platforms and systems that didn't communicate well together and/or did not allow us present the look and feel of our agency. With Giveffect we can easily accomplish all of our tasks from one platform AND on the front end of things it integrates seamlessly with our own website! From the get go, Giveffect's customer service has been top notch - they've had an answer for every question we've had and their team is readily available whether it is through their online ""Chat with Us"" feature, via phone or via email. They also do an amazing job of listening to feedback and the needs of their clients then turning around and implementing updates which allows them to offer all of us a continually evolving solution. I can't even begin to explain the amount of time we now have available each day to focus our energies on the important stuff - the kids in our program and our mission. Highly recommended!""","Recommendations to other buyers: I would encourage you to call those using the software for references and also TRY the demo! We did both of those things and haven't had one regret. Our biggest hangup initially was the migration to a new platform, but their team helped us handle this with ease. It seems to good to be true, but it is so worthwhile."

Giveffect was more expensive than what we intended to spend, however we felt like we were getting more for our money to bring so many processes under one roof and I was absolutely sold how the back end of the system talks to the front end.

There are no tedious forms to fill out to change or add fields, you can do most of it yourself. The campaigns are so easy to set up and easy to promote. Once your staff is familiar with the user experience troubleshooting is incredibly easy to manage. Donations come in with little to no issue. The team is so incredibly responsive and if we need something done differently it's almost always made available on the next upgrade. The tutorials are quick and painless to sit through and you can access them whenever you need to. Their webinar series is great and they do a wonderful job of keeping us up-to-date regarding changes, new functionality and upcoming tutorials and training.","Cons: There are a few pieces that are only available in the upper tier, which is a bummer. Also, the number of administrators we can have is limiting. The cost to add what we need is probably as much as moving to the next tier - which is slightly higher than we're prepared to pay right now.","Overall: Makes my job so much easier. The ability to customize letters, communications, campaigns saves me time. Also, it makes segmenting donors incredibly easy so that communications reach the right people at the right times.","Recommendations to other buyers: Get the highest level, it includes a super simple and beautiful drag and drop website tool that we love, lower credit card fees and the ability to add alot more users."

Additionally, there are many functions we'd appreciate more development on. We submit feedback very often, but our suggestions haven't been implemented yet. Hopefully it improves over time!","Overall: About a year in to our service with Giveffect, we trust our data much more. I pull reports every day and can rely on their accuracy. Our satisfaction with the software has gone up and down, but because of the efforts of their customer service team we are the happiest we've been to date.

It is much more manual than anticipated.","Overall: Giveffect works to update it's system and add features regularly.

It's fantastic that I can do that so easily and make each message so personalized. We've been using the ""Letter Template"" to print out ""Thank You Letters"" super easily. I just log the check and print out the letter and - 'I'm like, ok I'm done!' Even when I hand off the donations that I've inputted into the database to our finance department for our auditors to see: A) what donations I've entered, B) what fund I assigned the donations to - it's so easy for them to put import data into Quickbooks.

Improving interface

Customized

Compatible with Authorize.net

Reasonable cost

PDF Ticketing

Easy to train

Reliable and Available","Cons: Reporting still being developed/enhanced

Better testing and version control has been requested

No real-CRM capability for patron management/history

Development seems focused on ""new"" features (i.e. Facebook integration) more than refinement of existing features (i.e. reporting)

Error codes are confusing to patrons when transactions are not going through

Transaction/Administration speeds varies (system tweaking is needed after most iterations)",Overall: When we selected ThunderTix they were the only online ticket service that we could find that did not charge a 'per ticket service fee' to our customers. That model was vital to our selection as we do not believe online ticketing should be cost a premium over walk-ups.,

The online question and answer section is excellent.",Cons: Can't really think of anything.,"Overall: We've been using Thundertix since 2011 for my busy sailing tour and charter business. Before we chose Thundertix, we thoroughly evaluated at least five other online reservation/booking software systems and found that Thundertix's combination of features, simple user interface , powerful back end for reports and pricing could not be beat. We are often approached by other competitors and have sometimes looked at other systems to see if we're missing anything and Thundertix combination of features and pricing (no ticket fees) wins hands down every time. The fact that you have total control over any fees (or not) charged to your customers is very appealing. When on occasion, we've had a suggestion for an improvement, we've often seen it implemented. If you have an issue you can get someone to respond quickly. They're all excellent. Thundertix is really top-notch.","Recommendations to other buyers: I suggest you try it out.

Refunds & exchanges to multi day events can get very confusing. Most for us in theater as people will purchase tickets & exchange for another show time. The money flow can be confusing when doing the books for close out.","Overall: Thundertix has boosted our ticket sales for all events. It promotes advance registration and reduces cancellations, changes and refunds. However, having those options available in the system has made it easier for us to maneuver changes when they must be made.

Hands down, ThunderTix beats all of those ticketing sites. I pay a annual flat rate fee, therefor I know exactly what my cost will be for ticketing.

I have volunteered in a lot of areas over my years, but I've never been one of the main people behind starting a non profit much less throwing a concert and golf scramble in the same day. With a lot of amazing help from friends our events were successful. I credit thundertix with the ease of getting information to supporters. This kept our contributors in the know, they knew when to expect their tickets to be emailed. We started solitciting money 6 months before our event. We did not want to mail tickets to them 4 months before they needed them...



Please know when I say we had no experience, I mean we had none. Two of my friends who are either present/past treasurers of org. are also my treasurers. They input all the sponsorships, donations, ticket purchases, golf registrations, tshirt sales, etc. into thundertix. We were very hesitant at first, but with multiple calls to Pam initially and very frequently later, we are smooth sailing.She only showed concern and kindness when we called. This is so needed in our world today. I would recommend this to anyone who is selling tickets to an event.

The availability to contact your donors is at your fingertips. We decided to email tickets to customers 2 weeks before our event. We send an email right away, to let them know we have received their sponsorship, thank them for it and let them know when to expect their tickets. It makes it so easy for everyone. The supporters and in our case, our volunteers.

I spent many hours looking at different options and I know we made the right choice.

The customer service from Pam is more than it's weight in gold. I am not kidding, she could help with every issue. This is only our 3rd year to use the software, in this time period, there have been several ""upgrades"".

One other thing that made it really nice for us, especially as beginners, is the compatibility between thundertix and our credit card payment system. They worked it out behind the scenes where any credit card information is not on my website. When a customer hits the sponsorship or donate tab, they are immediately taken to another website where this information is taken on a much more encrypted safe site than mine.

In 2 years we have given back $265,000.00 to our community. There has been a lot of information submitted in Thundertix.",,,,

Our customers hated paying add on fees, and Thundertix was the only company that we found that did not charge that way.",

I also enjoy the incredibly fast response from their customer service. There is also a Request a Feature page and you can ad your request or problem to it and vote for others that have already been submitted. The Thundertix team works on the requests in order of votes or sometimes fixes a glitch right away. The newest feature I got really excited about is the shopping cart, which gives patrons the option to purchase several events in one transaction.",Cons: That I can't get into an attempted order by a customer who made a mistake (in real time). I have to wait until the remaining checkout time has passed instead of being able to cancel the transaction for them and to start over.,,

Now we are beginning year four, and they introduce new features every year! It is easy to set up events and manage the behind the scenes of the software, and even easier to use it to sell tickets on location at our events, and it's the easiest to purchase them as a customer! Its a win for everyone! Reports are easy to run and are complete and customizable as to what information is included on them. And one of my favorite newer features is a daily email with total sales.","Cons: I really like it all! Possibly entering coupon codes had a bit of a learning curve to it, but I have it down now and it works like a charm.","Overall: ThunderTix has been the best decision we could have made! It is all easy to use, and the Support Team is quick to respond and meet your needs. They also are always taking suggestions from their customers about new features to introduce! (They even credit the customer when they do!) And the pricing is perfect for those of us who do not sell tickets year-round. You move to maintenance months/pricing until you are ready to sell again. I have been the sole contact person for our company since day one, and have never had a anything but positive experiences with ThunderTix!",
5742,thundertix,ThunderTix continually provides outstanding service!,Alecia O.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2016-09-08,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"Comments: I was lucky enough to have found ThunderTix when I worked for The Cider Mill Playhouse in Endicott, New York, almost ten years ago. Stacy Chapman helped me learn the system and how to easily customize it for our oddly shaped (half circle thrust) theater. Our older, not-so-computer-savvy customers found it to be extremely user friendly and it really streamlined the box office experience too! Two years ago I became the Marketing Director for the Chenango Arts Council in Norwich, New York, whose ticketing system was really in need of updating. I suggested we look into ThunderTix, recalling the positive experience I had in the past. Stacy Chapman was still with the company and had gotten a well deserved promotion, but she remembered me from the Cider Mill! And I remembered her of course, because she was so helpful and proactive. The ThunderTix system proved to be exactly what we needed. Stacy once again held my hand through the set-up process, even though it wasn't really her job anymore. Pam Mason has also been extremely helpful, and our audience feedback reveals their experience just gets more and more enjoyable. What prompts me to write this is the almost uncanny ability ThunderTix has in predicting what I'm going to need next. The old seat blocking function allowed me to block our season subscribers' favorite seats so we could go online to the general public for ticket sales earlier than usual, which was great! But I faced the laborious old unblocking system which I knew would be time consuming. Lo and behold on September 1st, I can unblock seats with just a click!!! So happy! How did ThunderTix know? Just another example of listening to their clients and being proactively thinking ahead! I will always highly recommend ThunderTix to anyone looking for a straightforward, user-friendly, customer friendly, intuitive ticketing system, and I truly appreciate all the time and effort Stacy, Pam, and all the staff and programmers obviously put into their jobs. Well done, and THANK YOU!",,,,

Customer Service is quick, personable and very helpful. THUNDERTIX doesn't stand on its laurels, and each year a new addition, refinement, and addition to make our lives easier. As a 501C3 Organization with one event that funds our entire year's budget, we simply cannot have a problem. THUNDERTIX COMES THROUGH FOR US, YEAR AFTER YEAR.","Cons: Initial set up fee to integrate our theater venue into the software was a bit expensive, but amortized over a period of years, it's been a worthwhile investment.","Overall: It's friendly user interface for both vendor and customer, makes buying tickets easy to administer, even for casual internet users.

I tested several vendors. We wanted to control what our patrons paid (if anything) to purchase tickets. So many vendor's pass on these high costs to the patrons to pay for the service. But Thundertix allows us to set the costs we might choose to pass on to our patrons. Not to mention that the cost of implementation was very reasonable and almost painless. They worked with us to customize and integrate their site to maintain the same look and feel of ours. Most of our patrons have no idea they're even on a third party site when buying tickets. Now they're taking things to the next level and integrating even more tools into their system that people use every day (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, YouTube and MySpace). They're always working to enhance their system. Their response to issues is like lightening. So the thunderbolt logo is very appropriate.",Cons: I honestly cannot think of any cons. And that is something you don't hear every day.,"Overall: I along with the rest of our board would highly recommend Thundertix to any organization looking for a simple, easy to use ticketing site that allows you to take control and save your patrons money and save yourself time. They are always improving their site and introduce new features, many of which come at no addtional cost, for their customers. They are extremely responsive to any questions, concerns or any unlikely problems you might encounter. They really are the best.",

We also utilize the plugins like Constant Contact which helps reduce time spent entering emails of attendees on the back-end before sending out a mass email. The ease of editing an event is also appreciated.",Cons: It takes quite awhile to populate/generate a report when you want to export sometimes.,"Overall: Southern Arizona Arts & Cultural Alliance switched to ThunderTix for all ticket sales several years ago and its improved our ability to manage all facets of ticking for our events. As a non-profit, the bottom-line is also always a consideration and we find that ThunderTix is the most affordable ticketing service that gives the most bang-for-your-buck on the market.",

It was VERY easy to scan tickets with the app as well.,"Cons: It's not as intuitive. Finding out where to click to sell tickets, to design tickets, how to make them look the way we needed them to look...it actually required note-taking that I could refer to because things weren't in the obvious places to look. But once that was learned, it became easy to make the software do what we needed. I feel like part of it might actually be the web design as opposed to the software...for example, there are two rows of tabs. The top row is supposed to be related to your account, and the second row to your specific event. It doesn't SAY that anywhere, and I think there are exceptions, but we had to figure it out. (Notice that I'm still not sure about that, and I've been the one primarily working on the event.) I feel like someone on the phone would have figured that out right away and told us and saved us a couple of hours of clicking, but finding a phone number is next to impossible. Email is responsive, though, so it's not like they leave you completely in the dark. It's just not convenient.","Overall: I'm not sure that we did. I do know that I'd want to try it again now that we understand it more and see if we can make it fit our needs in other areas. After that, I'll decide if I'd be willing to recommend it.",

In addition to their standard support features, a Facebook group offers insights and a chance to chat with other users to see how they do things and what is working well in their organizations.","Cons: There isn't anything that comes to mind as a true ""Con"" to the software.

I work in the Corporate Office in Gruene and we use Thundertix for our ticketing system for Gruene Hall. As you can imagine Thundertix plays a vital role in our day to day tickets sales and we rest assured knowing they are always making sure everything is up and running and that if there is a problem that they are working to fix it as quick as possible.

It is easy to set up as event and make corrections.","Cons: There are three things that we would suggest:

Ticket Sales Exchange - If the customer requests to change tickets to another day, and split the reservation to different sections, we had to do multiple transactions. If the exchange was on 3 sections of the auditorium, we have to work on 3 separate transaction.

I like that there is a flat fee and that it does not charge per ticket like most services because some of our tickets are on top of that this is a 25% increase! The scanning feature has been really helpful. Also, I have had all my questions answered quickly when I take the time to ask for help.","Cons: I do not find it easy to use or intuitive. I struggle to navigate the interface every time I get on it. On the scanning tickets end it is easy to use but on the management end it is not easy. Perhaps it will become easier as I use it more. But so far, I am frustrated with it in that way. Also, I do not see easy ways for the system to track the demographics of my customers or features along demographical lines. I wish there was more of this type of feature.","Overall: We use it to sell tickets for all our big major events. It helps us sell tickets and scan people as they arrive when we are expecting 4,000 people!",

I combine the online system with an Authorize.net gateway payment system. I have used 3 different online ticketing platforms in the past and NOTHING compares to the benefits of ThunderTix. You set it up and maintain it yourself, no waiting for your IT folks to do it for you (nor having to pay for their time), which also means you can change things on the fly as you need to, it integrates easily with Authorize.net (or other payment systems) and you get your money from sales in 1 day, and you just cannot beat their pricing!! And did I mention the excellent customer service? Not only is their online forum very helpful, but when I was in really dire need of real live help, I just emailed them and usually had an answer within a couple hours.

It streamlined the customer buying experience, it was easy to set up new agents so that we could, in effect, expand office hours, the reports are informative and easy to customize, and customer service has been excellent. The flat monthly rate model works very well for us.","Cons: Need some additional fields in the exported reports so that I can get a better feel for who my customers are, where they come from, how many order online as opposed to over the phone, how much I collect in fees, that sort of thing.","Overall: I highly recommend Thundertix.

Here are a few impressions that I have.

PROS:

1. My contact, Pam Mason, is very prompt and helpful.

2. When things are in place there seems to be no calculation errors of any sort.

3. The reports have lots of valuable information and help us keep up with stats.

4. The ""Forum"" is very helpful.

5. The cost is very fair.

NEEDS:

1. A graphics section to build auditorium maps with.

2. A whole auditorium view to see seat availability without changing screens. This would quicken ""at the door"" sales because customers could choose their seats more easily.

3. More clarity on using email notifications. If there is a cost involved it should show before one has to click the button and decide.

4. A way to run fake credit card test transactions without involving the gateway. This would make it easier to train staff.

5. I have not been able to ""void"" tickets which I should be able to do within 24 hours according to your information.

6. When emailed tickets fail to ""send"" there is no error message.

7. PC computers seem to have glitches in printing. My MacBook allows me to just hit ""Print Tickets"" but my PC seems to have to go back to where I can make the tickets appear as a PDF.

8. The ""See All Dates"" button needs to appear on many pages such as when one is looking at ""Orders"", ""Customers"", etc.",,,,

Thank you!","Cons: I can't think of anything I liked least...We are in a unique situation in that our tickets sell out within minutes. The only concern was that the event showed up as sold out before it actually was sold out, because ticket purchasers had the tickets in their carts and there has to be a 10 minute hold time before releasing the tickets if they are not purchased.

But.... This product impressed me.

Event setup is simple and intuitive. Reports are clear and easy to read. Database import was easy (they imported it for us but required only one edit from my original data). Integration with payment gateway and email service was trivial.

Web interface is modern and clean. Coupons, donations, products are all effortless to create.

Price is excellent.","Cons: Some pages need refreshing after edits, a glitch I am willing to bet is fixed before you read this. Experienced very slight occasional server lag during event definitions, but could easily be internet . Not a problem when purchasing when used as box office terminal.",Overall: Inexpensive event ticketing is no small benefit.

They seem to even be concerned about quickly changing their system to benefit you from their open customer support page. You can see what the customers complained about, and even how they solved it.

It was our first ticketing software type project and this was such a plug and play software that it made us look like geniuses to our clients. Thanks to the ThunderTix team for the support!,

It was easy to review and I liked how the program was Lifetime and updated often. We had a specific limit of seats we could sell and so we were checking it frequently to make sure we did not over sell our event.,Cons: You really had to search around to get reports to print easily. I wish we could have refined exactly what we were looking for and just print that report,Overall: The benefit that we really utilized was keeping track of how many seats we sold so that we would not over sell our event. And also keep track of the revenue we were taking in to make sure the event was going to be prosperous for our non for profit organization. I also like that the fee was not so much that people felt are Booster program wasn't benefiting for the full amount of the ticket.,

We have been using Thundertix for three years. I spent months researching the different options and I know that I made the right choice. The software is very easy to use and they are always thinking of ways to improve the system. There is an upgrade nearly every month where new features are announced or improved. Our price has never been raised despite the addition of many new features. Pam and the rest of the service team are quick to answer and get things done. Recently a new update feature created a small issue for us. Pam was quick to get the tech team working on a solution for us and before we knew it a new feature had been created just for us. It's a small enough company that you get to talk to an actual person when you call! Imagine that! We couldn't be happier with Thundertix.,,,,

Back then, the Thundertix features were few but we didn't need anything fancy - just a reliable ticketing system that was user friendly. However, it didn't take us long to have a wish list for features, and Dawn and Stacy considered each of our requests regardless of how big or small. They are a fantastic partner to work with, and we always feel like a VIP customer.

The rival service advertised similar features but the reality was far from what was advertised. The customer service was nonexistent with the other company.

All inclusive package options at price points we can pick. Customer service was reliable and we always had all our questions answered - if an answer was unavailable then our rep made sure to find a solution we could work with. Inexpensive and extremely competitive. We have used other software from competing vendors and honestly would recommend PurplePass before recommending other software. Lots of great programming options based on our individual needs and not so overly complicated that we need an IT degree to manipulate the software - that is the bonus! Our rep, Gabriel, was great to work with and responsive to our sometimes wacky questions.","Cons: We really liked the software as it is very competitive to other programs available on the market. The only two drawbacks we found include integration onto websites - it doesn't allow the user to stay on the website - it kept forwarding to PurplePass url. Perhaps this is due to our website software - WIX- but that was slightly annoying for our users. The other drawback is really more of a suggestion - while the software is easy to use and the search functions are great - there was not enough promotions by PurplePass for the events listed. It would be great to have a calendar of upcoming events promoted through social media or on the site itself - we found we had to ""search"" for our event and thought it would be a better selling point for PurplePass to offer ""promotions"" on the site and suggested events. Target market on social media for example.","Overall: Easy to use, functionality, competitive price, friendly and responsive reps.",

If we wanted to scan we could only be on the ""scanning mode"", if we had a walk-in attendee that needed to purchase a ticket we had to remember to change modes.

It worked fine at the beginning, but we started having many problems with it and it couldn't handle our ticketing load. So we started researching alternative ticketing solutions to implement. We tested around 10 different systems to determine what would work best for us. In the end, we chose Purplepass. Purplepass had the most features, was the easiest to implement, and was the lowest cost to operate. Whenever we had questions, Purplepass was always quick to respond and help us get the support we needed. We have been very happy using Purplepass.

From start to finish, it has been so easy to have a smooth event. The representative we spoke with was AMAZING and made the new information so simple. The tickets that we received for our event were STUNNING and having the ability to just scan them allowed for our guests to have a nice keepsake ticket.

Their interface to select seats simple stood out among the rest, and it super easy to configure. Our's was a special use case though, because we are membership based society which has several grades of membership. People already become members and are then given a choice of seats in their allocated zone. When we contacted Purplepass and told them our requirements, they responded back saying that it was a too complicated for their current system and that it will require them to change their internal engine to support this need. We however were very interested to go forward with this idea. At our end we created some web-services to access our data and made it available to Purplepass. Then we wrote a full requirement specification for Purplepass to implement. They started on the project a few weeks before the event and in one week or so, they had a prototype ready for us using our specification. We did some testing to make sure it met our needs, and went through a few more iterations perfecting it to an acceptable level. Note that this was done under a severe time crunch and Purplepass were very prompt in delivering our needs. We did launch a week before the event date and everyone was thrilled with the interface. As a bonus the interface also allowed the ability for members to re-allocate their seats after they have already selected their seats once. We also got thermal-printer tickets printed for the entire hall and rented scanners for box-office use. This was super easy to use. Overall I was very pleased with the experience and will use it going forward when we have big events like these.",,,,

I've never felt like I was being nickle and dimed for promoting my event and, with the proper amount of time put into designing each ticketing page, they look far more professional, enticing, and on brand with whatever you might be promoting. The ambiance required to get my audience on-board with each of my immersive experiences begins with the ticket links and it is both a satisfying and refreshing to know this is available and reliable on Purplepass.","Cons: The learning curve for the more advance options was overwhelming at first and there are sometimes setbacks when paying the listing prices back to the company but both are easily fixed and overlooked.

The lack integration with platforms such as Facebook is irritating at times as tickets cannot be listed as readily on a Facebook event or boosted post but, with some creativity and patience this, too, can be overcome.",Overall: Overall its been stellar. Far more so than the other sites I've used previously that use smaller event companies' reliance on a fancy ticketing platform to gouge extra money for capabilities that should come standard.,

The system works flawlessly !,Arman F.,Gate Co-chair,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2015-07-08,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,10.0,"Comments: We had a few adjustments we needed to make during the 2 day event. Gabe of Purple Pass made those adjustments immediately and kept us purring right along. We had 4 cashiers to handle the cash transactions. We had 4 shifts during the 2 days with 4 cashiers and 2-4 scanners. They were all volunteers. The touchscreens and software was intuitive and training for each shift was quick and painless. Around half of our ticket sales were on line. Those guests only had to be scanned. In the future we will need less cashiers. We had some issues with QR codes which were poorly printed and some folks who printed the receipt and not the ticket. Some folks had tickets on their smart phones and the screens were hard to read with the scanners.

Gabe was right there and immediately solved those problems and kept the guests happy. The stats which were available any time for the asking were invaluable during the event and planning for our next one. This was our 2nd year with Purple Pass. Last year the system was good but we had problems with the broadband service and credit card processing. Not a Purple Pass caused problem. The software, the touch screens and scanner were all better than last year. They keep getting better and better. I would not hesitate to recommend their system and especially the staff that supports it. Arman Freeman, La Jolla Festival of the Arts",,,,

Considering we were implementing a new system, both events ran surprisingly well. I am not a technical person, but the system is very intuitive, and the tutorials are very helpful. The post-event data collection feature was an eye opener; it will be tremendously helpful as TEF looks to future marketing efforts.

They have the key attributes of a successful enterprise. We look for relationships with people who have the Capacity and the Integrity to operate in this competitive Creative world of ours.

On the other hand, people with the Integrity (honest with a great work ethic) may not have the knowledge and experience to perform at the levels our industry requires.

Choosing a solution for an entire season of concerts is a big step. osConcert was affordable but more importantly provides so much flexibility. I had very specific needs. Integration with Stripe and/or Square was necessary and it was implemented. Integration with Infusionsoft was crucial and it was implemented.

I have talked to many of our customers and have received many positive comments. The seating plan set up and look is the first thing that attracts people and it is easy to use for the average computer user. It is also easy to set up for a booking agent who can then sell hard copy tickets directly to the public. If I have one small negative comment it is the ticket printing which many people seem to struggle with so perhaps this could be looked at in the future. All of the background information storage is easy to access and making changes to the seating and editing is simple. The customer support from Gordon has been exceptional from the early days of my learning about the software right up to today and email responses are very quick when a problem needs to be solved.

Finally I would like to say I highly recommend osconcert to all businesses looking for value for money ticketing software.",Recommendations to other buyers: If you are looking for value for money ticketing software then look no further.

- Raklet does not still allow to keep a register of Contacts of Persons that are not yet MEMBERS. Therefore we cannot envoy Newsletter to them, nor envoy promotional messages or Invites.

- The graphic possibilities of Newsletters might be potentiated.

- It might be good to let New Members of our Association to read Italianinformations about Raklet and few but clear instruction about its use.

- It might be developped the use of Raklet as Social Network of Members.

The Raklet team is very friendly and is willing to help and assist with any adaptions and where ever possible. Their development prices are quite competitive.,"Cons: It seems to be an ongoing project where major developments can be only expected if paid for. This means that basic functionalities should be checked before a decision is made. Adaptions will cost you extra. A high number of smaller developments are risking to get a kind of ""messy code"" - Therefore, in my opinion, a basic revision of the Raklet code every now and then would be a reasonable measure.","Overall: We are using Raklet as a membership management tool in combination with the private social network. For our members, it is implemented as a membership area, where they can share their details and information about themselves as well as details about their affiliation. The details are basically our stock of data about our members. So they have to keep their details updated and we save time for other tasks. We are also using the events function of Raklet which enables us to sell tickets to our members and the public charging them different event ticket prices. That is very practical because it is automatically checked whether one is a member or not. We are also using the Email function which enables us to send automated emails on the basis of pre-designed forms. Another important function for us was the relatively new developed function of Raklet ""pages"" which enabled us to publish content within the private social network that should be seen from our members only. This was a crucial point to us because we had this area on our website first and were not willing to have a double login, one for Raklet and one for the member area on our website. Therefore, we are glad that we have had the support of the Raklet team and would recommend you to use Raklet.","Recommendations to other buyers: GO ON and let us to have also a complete Italian version, if possible!

I'm not going to milk it tho there is some little ideas I've sprung that are in the road map to coming on the platform which I fully understand. Rome wasn't built in a day. Can't recommend these guys enough.,"Recommendations to other buyers: When the event is capped at 500 it should work side by side with the tickets on sale. For example maybe a slider option to put tickets on/off sale because when it shows how many are left, it's not how many up to the 500 it's how many you've put on sale. Ticket template info box never keeps the data. I have to write the info every time I put a ticket on sale."

- 64bit windows needs work to improve work flow

First on-line sales, followed by pick-your-own seat.","Recommendations to other buyers: Over all I can't see myself using any other software. Features vs price can't be beat.

All functions are controlled internally. The software allows for online ticketing with a very professional appearance. It eliminates the need for other related software i.e. funds development and volunteer coordination.,"Cons: - Many of the more advance features takes a lot of training.

- 64bit windows needs work to improve work flow

- Requires robust computers for good performance","Overall: We have been using TM since 2002. It was a big investment for us at that time. However, it was also one of the most affordable options and immediately improved our functionality . The TM team is great at assessing your needs and giving you what you need and not over selling you. We eventually grew and TM was able to grow with us. The system allows for one stop shopping for ticketing, funds development, facilities management and volunteer coordination. I have yet to find a function from other high priced box office systems that TM cannot provide.

TM support is friendly, knowledgable and helpful. Typically, they respond within the hour and can get you fixed up promptly. One drawback is night and weekend support is not part of the standard support package. That being said, I have only needed support a handful of times on weekends since 2002.

One of the best features of TM is the ability to sell tickets online via your website without a third party. This eliminates high ticketing fees to outside vendors. Any fees charged stays with the venue. This is a great way to fund your ticketing system investment.

Training for employees is relatively easy. A few hours of training will allow a person to process basic ticket orders. Additional functions such as donations, season subscriptions and gift certificate sales might take additional time. Typically they are learned on the job.

Some specialized functions needed to sell package tickets or other non typical functions online will require a plug in. Plug ins are paid for separately and scheduled in advance through IT.

Another great feature is the ability to provide box office services to other organizations within your community or in different spaces. TM allows for multiple venues and seating configurations and pricing options. This can also provide additional revenue streams to your organization.

Artsman is a small and well run company. You have direct access to all levels of management and ownership. They are very sensitive to your needs and feedback and often respond in very positive ways. I have made comments or suggestions that eventually make their way into a future updates. I highly recommend this company and product.","Recommendations to other buyers: Over all I can't see myself using any other software. Features vs price can't be beat.

There is nothing we've asked of TM that it cannot do, or that their developers haven't been able to make happen. Theatre software is difficult and complex, and usually not very intuitive. In that sense, this is the same! But once you learn how to do what you need to, there is not a better value out there.","Cons: Anything I've not liked over the years (mobile access, slow load times, etc) has all been corrected in future development. I've not liked that I cannot export, as a file, multiple phone numbers which is a holdover from landline days. But I expect that will be fixed shortly.","Overall: We are a regional theatre with a 900+ seat house, and multiple weeks of sales for multiple productions. We can initiate any promo, seating package or report that we need. If we don't know how to do it, the customer support team will figure it out.","Recommendations to other buyers: Over all I can't see myself using any other software. Features vs price can't be beat.

I have used it at two different organizations, and it has served our needs nicely. The support team is responsive and helpful. Like most software, you get out of it what you put in. If your staff are willing to learn the system and get excited about all the ways it can help, then it's wonderful! If you have a staff who don't like to learn new things and aren't inquisitive about ""I wonder how I find this information or use this to help me do x, y, and z"", then you will not be getting your money's worth. It can do almost everything you need a CRM database to do, but you have to be willing to put the training and time in to take full advantage of its features. It's intuitive for those who are tech-savvy and see the value of multi-dimensional data (I fall into that group), but may not be valued by those who aren't quick to adapt to new technology (some of my colleagues fall into this group). I highly recommend this product for organizations that are interested in data and using technology to help them do their work better and more efficiently. Even if you use it only to sell tickets (though it does SO MUCH MORE), it is likely a step up from any third party vendors you are currently using (it definitely was for us).","Recommendations to other buyers: Over all I can't see myself using any other software.

It integrates events, classes, donors and volunteers all in one place. Works well most of the time. Bugs happen, but they get fixed. When I see things that need attention, they're always quick to respond and implement changes as needed.","Cons: Reports are a bit overwhelming. Wish there was some sort of cheat sheet...that tells you, ""If you're looking to find out this...this report will help...""","Overall: I think Theater Manager is amazing because it's fully integrated and makes it easy to track everything. The only software that combines all four basic functions...ticketing, classes, donors and volunteers. I also love a lot of the new things they're implementing. The feature to allow patrons to set up their own payment plan online for certain classes is amazing...and was even easier than I thought it would be . The tech service is great too...they're all so fun to talk to on the phone and usually resolve the problem quickly and easily.","Recommendations to other buyers: Try it, it's fun. Easy to use..."

From the sales rep, tech support and even the founder - my questions are answered quickly leading to a high level of customer satisfaction. The Theatre Manager software is user friendly, with quick online help links for additional details. The box office, development and overall CRM functionality has greatly streamlined our organization's operations allowing us to devote more time to programming and promotion.",Recommendations to other buyers: Spend some time training on the new system with your entire staff to learn the software as a collective - it will be helpful in the future as questions arise.

Customer support is also a huge benefit - they are there when we need them with fast response times and friendly smart people.","Cons: Hosting internal hardware and all that goes along with it. I know there is now a cloud hosting option but its too expensive for our organization to consider at this point.

The developers have thought of just about everything this we as an event company could need from ticketing solution. It is versatile and easy to interrogate to get information when needed. The scanning API works well (dependent on your location)all in all a good all round ticketing tool.","Cons: There are very few things that we dislike about the system. What we have noticed is that the developer listens to the end user and therefore the system is still to a small extend 'Work in Progress'

Page functionality (tabbing forwards and backwards) we know is being looked at.

To be honest, there is very little to dislike about Coconut tickets","Overall: If anything Coconut has helped resolve problems rather than creating any. Our previous ticketing solution that was used for an Ice Rink was cumbersome and difficult to add customer to with Telephone sales, with Coconut it is easy, and through conversation with the developer we know there are still more (very minor) improvements going to be made in this specific area.",

We were using word document application forms before and manually inputting data. I had been looking for an online solution for quite a while when Coconut Tickets got in touch. Their vendor pitch feature is exactly what I was looking for and I can do everything in one place - applications, document uploads, email templates and payments. I haven't found another solution out there that does exactly what I need. Their customer service is also absolutely amazing - very fast response, quick bug fixing and even making improvements based on my suggestions.","Cons: As Coconut Tickets vendor pitches is a fairly new feature there have been a few bugs and teething problems along the way. However, as I explained above, their customer service has been amazing and all issues have been fixed very quickly. I have almost been a guinea pig as this feature has developed and have offered suggestions of improvement, which have been taken on board massively. Certain tools can sometimes be a little difficult to understand at first, but i would definitely stick with it, ask for help, and it will solve all your trader applications needs!","Overall: Coconut Tickets has helped us transfer our trader/vendor process from a manual, time consuming task to a an easier and much faster process. Traders can fill in an online application form, submit their bids/choose their pitches, upload all H&S documents and agree to our T&Cs. All this info is stored within my CC profile and I can also export all information as an excel spreadsheet as well as download all documents. There a number of different pitch sales formats available that suit all our needs and as I said above, the customer service is wonderful!",

We were looking for an affordable and easy to use mobile bidding auction program and this one did not disappoint. The company sends a representative to the auction to basically be the point person and fix anything that might come up and help with check in, entering data, etc. They show up early and stay through the event. They bring tablets that are easy to use for our volunteers and staff.

Entering items and bidders is easy and functional. Your event can go live as soon as you'd like it to so that even donors that can't attend the night of, can bid on items. This increases revenue tremendously. They also helped us with not having small items but focusing on larger items of value and only having around 100-150 silent items. The colorful pictures and descriptions are easy to view on mobile devices. And if guests don't have a smart phone, we can help them bid on our tablets.

Guests receive notification of being outbid, but you can add am amount you are willing to pay and Gesture will continue bidding on your behalf until the amount is reached.

Guests are also able to check out from their device, so it makes check out a lot faster and smoother.

It is a lot easier to collect on balances as well because we collect credit card information before the event.

Guests received notification of being outbid, but you can add am amount you are willing to pay and Gesture will continue bidding on your behalf until the amount is reached.","Cons: If the tablets go down at check in, it pretty much puts everything at a stand still. Even though the tablets run without wi-fi.","Overall: Most of our donors and guests loved the new aspect of our Auction, including switching to mobile bidding/checking in and out. Instead of the previous years of pen and paper bidding. There were only a few people that preferred the old method and just couldn't seem to get on bored. People were concerned that guests would be on their phones all night and no one would be interacting but it was quite the opposite. People had more time to mingle not having to go back and check the paper bid sheets since there were none.",

It's intuitive and easy to navigate. It makes my job as an event manager much easier. Adding auction items, auction close out, and financial reporting are a breeze. It is also a smooth process for our guests. Bidding on auction items or making a donation is very easy for them, which means more donations for our cause. We set up our auction online in advance of the event. This gives guests an opportunity to start bidding on silent items, and become familiar with live auction items. All of this leads to more revenue to support our mission. I also appreciate the ability to customize our site so it looks like us. This creates a cohesive experience for our guests and helps us put our brand front and center. As a site administrator, I love the ability to download the generated auction sheets. This is a huge time saver. We also download the receipts and send to guests with a thank you letter after the event. It calculates the tax deductibility automatically on the receipt which is an essential feature.","Cons: There are a few custom queries/reports I would like which are not currently offered. It can be confusing as an admin to see clearly what funds have been paid and not paid. However, the staff are great and have helped me figure things out. They even created a custom report for me.",,

Bidders loved how easy it was to register for the silent auction, and we benefitted greatly from launching the website and opening the auction prior to the event. There were many easy tutorials for our volunteers to watch so that they could get comfortable with the online bidding system, and they were well equipped to handle questions from guests. We benefitted greatly from having an onsite specialist with us at the event. She was extremely professional, smart, highly capable and knowledgeable about the software, and she worked nimbly and confidently throughout the night to answer any questions and even offered suggestions that contributed significantly to the success of our auction - and on top of that, she was very enjoyable to be with! After the event, we were able to easily close our books and to process all payments (a significant improvement from many years of dealing with cash and checks and tracking down payments) and to run reports providing incredible data for us to review and learn from.",Cons: I cannot think of anything to improve this software. It was perfect for our event - simple to use and very geared toward serving a volunteer-based event!,"Overall: Streamlined auction process before, during and after event. We went ""paperless"" and didn't have to fuss with paper bidding forms and associated headaches. We raised more than $10,000 more than we ever raised before using an online bidding system. We look forward to using again next year!",

Bidders receive texts when they have been outbidded. You are able to create endless silent and live auction items for your page. Event support is so responsive and you are able to customize your support needs for in state and out of state events. Their team arrive to your event with ipads to complete donor bidder profiles on site. They will come to your booth in exhibit hall and encourage people to register for bidding. They are super friendly and outgoing and are great as live auction spotters. They raise far more than their cost and double our giving. You are able to even enter in different pledge amounts as donation items on the auction site.,"Cons: They are a little costly however it's worth it for a smooth, successful event. I do wish the website was a little more attractive and grouped the silent and live items together. The items appear kind of small and cramped together.",Overall: GiveSmart provides much needed day of event support as well as an easy to use interface for auction bidding. Reporting has helped ease the closeout process and assure everyone receives their items and we receive payment. They send continuous follow-up to donors for payment post event. You also have access to crowdfunding for 6 months after your event has ended.,

Features offered have improved each year we have contracted with Givesmart. ""One stop shopping"" for event and auction management. We have utilized more features each year. What started as just utilizing auction management capability with limited effort into making the online auction site attractive has evolved to guest ticketing, table assignments, a highly customized auction site that reflects the event theme and with real time auction progress and bids scrolling on large screen ad televisions throughout the event venue to increase people's competitive bidding nature. After action information has been vital to determining what auction items had the most interests and highest profit margin. Has enabled us to better focus solicitation efforts for the next year.",Cons: Really very few cons for the software. Only limitation observed was limited printing options for auction item description for printing on card stock. There needs to be several options for the size and information/photo of the descriptive card tents.,Overall: Nearly full event management by using this software.,

I thoroughly appreciate Gesture's frequent software updates. They are continuously in search of even better ways to improve upon the customer experience, which they communicate through their Gesture Innovation Center emails. I believe that they value customer opinions and implement suggestions, accordingly. As an event planner, other companies often approach me, but none offer the experience Gesture has given my clients over the years. Our account manager, Allie Erickson is on top of our every need, patient, accessible, friendly and helpful. Our on-site manager is thoughtful, communicative, professional and kind. The Gesture team is trustworthy, diligent and fully dedicated to their customers. Every year, our attendees highly rate Gesture in our post-event survey.

The transition from paper building to mobile has drastically increased our pre-event and day of event fundraising. My favorite part about the software is the increase in funds collected the night of the event. It was incredibly unfortunately how much staff time we had to dedicate post event to collecting money, for many of our events we not have 100% funds collected the night of the event, which frees our staff up to focus on thanking donors. Lastly, the interface is very easy to understand and navigate. We have a number of events that have more mature attendees, who were skeptical when we began to make the transition from paper to electronic. After one use they all required we use the technology at future events. This is also a credit to the Gesture onsite staff who really meet the attendees where they are at and give extra attention when needed!","Cons: I guess my comments would be both a pro and a con. The fact that Gesture is constantly evolving and improving the technology it can sometimes be hard to keep up with all of the current offerings and capabilities as a client. This is one of many vendors you work with so it can be hard to keep yourself educated. Although, this is when you really rely on your account manager to relay this information to you, which our, representtaive, does a wonderful job.",,

I also really like the ease in which bidders can participate, get alerts, and have knowledge of their purchases. Finally, the added bonus of a PR team to work with was an extra perk I was not expecting!","Cons: There are certain gaps in the software we have discovered such as: Nowhere to record solicitors such as staff, committee, or Board member who was responsible for bringing in the item; Nowhere to record an individual's name associated with a company in donor details; Nowhere to record details for pledged item, such as when it will be delivered, staff pick-up needs, etc.; Need to have ability to check box if donor has already received thank you for their contributions (such as when it went unsold at a past event and is being used again); Non-transferrable input from one event to another such as donor information. I also have major concerns over the software abilities to capture donations during the ask. There is simply no way to ensure those that raise their hands, are actually hitting the button to donate that is texted to them.","Overall: During this first year in using the software, I saw the additional benefit of securing bids in advance of opening the auction. This started us out thousands of dollars ahead of where we would have traditionally began at the event.",

I am new to the website and it only took me about an hour to figure everything out. Everything is pretty self explanatory. I had to create an auction site for a silent and live auction. Adding each item came with ease. When you go to add an item each section is categorized telling you exactly what information to put in. I also found it very easy to go back and change things if I had made a mistake. The site is easy for others to use and view the auction items I posted. I felt that the crowd we were trying to attract was the older generation of people and this site allowed them to have the ability to see each item without complication. I really liked that the software told you who was watching certain items. It was easy to generate an item sheet in order to print them out and post them for our auction.,Cons: I think my least favorite thing about this software is trying to figure out when someone bids higher than you and who it is. I found that I had trouble when I bid on an item. My friend and I really wanted an item and we kept out bidding each other but didn't realize we were the only two bidding. I wish it would tell you who is bidding against yo.,Overall: I had a wonderful experience with this software. I found it was easy to make my own auction site.,

In addition to the software, you get actual people that run the software the day of the event.","Cons: One challenge I have found is that the information from last year's event doesn't carry over to the next year. Since we typically get a lot of the same donors, I have to re-enter donors from scratch instead of having the system ""remember"" them from last year.","Overall: Good overall experience, we will use them again next year. Custom service for the software is very responsive. Most of the people they send to the event are very polite and professional, but we have had a couple of people that have not been the best at representing our organization.",

The spreadsheets can be sorted as you like for your purposes. I also like the messaging. You can send out text messages to your guests for reminders like auction open for bidding, parking, auction closing, links to photos post event, etc. You can also generate tax letters from the site. A lot of great features!","Cons: The only thing I wish it could do is generate tax letters for each guest separately. If you need to make a change for one guest, you have to generate all letters as they go into a single PDF file. You can't just generate them for one guest. Not a major problem, just wish it was a feature. Overall it is a great system!","Overall: I have been able to generate reports that I need for sharing with my committee and for tax letters. Also, the on-line bidding system is a favorite of our guests. I love the messaging too. It allows me to send messages to my guests pre, during, and post event.",

The organizations has utilized GiveSmart for 4 years and has never had an issue. When they assign an event representative to you, you can be assured that any question you may have in setting up the auction site or any technical problems that you may have will be resolved immediately by the assigned rep or they will ensure that they find the right person to correct the issue or answer the question if they cannot immediately help. In addition to the auction management, their pacakge allows for FULL event management; everything from","Cons: Cost of using the service would be the only negative, and not really a negative because their costs are actually lower than some other options that the organization looked into.","Overall: Cannot sing their praises more. If you want to go with a group that honestly cares about wanting to make your event a success, use GiveSmart.",

The staff from gestures that helped during the event was knowledgeable and able to help and respond quickly and effectively during the event went on which made it less chaotic feeling for us.","Pros: I love that gesture was easy for our guests to use at our gala. We used it for check in and the process was simple and easy to understand for our volunteers at registration to find info. We used it for our silent auction and guests were able to see the items from their phones and bid very easily and they received notices when they were outbid or when they won. We used it for general donations, selling centerpieces, and checkout. Overall pretty easy to use during the event.","Cons: During the check in process we were unable to search by table number which would have been helpful because sometimes we are asked who is sitting at a certain table and it would be nice to look up by table. Also after the event we needed specific reports to be able to input all of the money we received and record all of the info and gestures did not yet have one comprehensive report to give us what we needed, instead I had to modify and combine several reports to make it work for our needs.",,

We also enjoyed the categories options for items and the ease of creating and managing the tickets portal.",Cons: Some of the features like not being able to manage donations made pre-event and the donation thermometer is lack luster. We went from doing a paddle raise to doing all mobile donations and did not feel the thermometer display was as exciting or captured the attention of guests. We did not realize until the night of the event that in order to show progress in the thermometer we had to keep refreshing the page. Just not what we were expecting.,"Overall: Ease of ticket sales and managing all of our fundraising items including silent auction, games, and donations.",

We like the auction capabilities and simplicity of use. We like that Gesture makes enhancements and improvements based on user feedback. We like the ability to use the helpdesk chat function when we have a question. We like the dashboard and reports. Unrelated to software , but a nice customer service perk is that you have a rep designated to you.","Cons: A few improvements can be made (as with any software) and when I suggest them, they are escalated.

I have been very pleased over the years and plan to continue to use Gesture.",Overall: I have recommended this product to quite a few non profits for the ease of use and the fact that it combines several event planning tasks into one platform.,
6345,givesmart,Such an upgrade from doing an auction on paper.

The reporting functionality is fantastic and I love being able to see results in real time.","Cons: 1. I wish we could have several screens for the same item. Silent Auction packages are sometimes made up of a few items and it would be nice to showcase those items visually on more than one available page.

2. Similarly, the automated process of creating table tents/placards for your project is not ideal. The available space for an image is too small, as is font size. You don't want people squinting at your package descriptions.",Overall: Ease of use and real time results. Also having GiveSmart employees at the event.,
6346,givesmart,The technology allows us to run great auctions and easy registration.,Judi S.,Director of Special Events,,Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,2018-05-13,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,9.0,,"Pros: It makes every aspect of running the inside logistics so much easier.

It's incredibly motivating to see our progress as the event unfolds. We also can compare last year's dashboard to this years and know where we need to step it up. The second best feature are the sponsor ads. We like how they are not only on the homepage but integrated through the software.,"Cons: Limited design capability and limited selection on display board that we used for Fund the Need. We thought sponsors names would appear after they hit the donate button, but names kept coming alphabetically.",Overall: Great tracking of donors and donations; an easy and effective platform to highlight sponsors of our event; a great summary of our night.,

Also, inputting registrants who pay with a check. Honestly, just about everything or we would not have used Gesture for a second time. Support was fantastic!","Cons: Online Help! Difficult to navigate when in a hurry, too many screens to go through, need to print help or have a download capability such as a User Manual especially for new people. This might seem trite but the blue ""Help"" button is in the way when trying to work with a list or read a screen. Keep it at the top and turn it blue.

We LOVE our account rep - she is super responsive. The folks that come out to work the auction are always wonderful too. The extra staff support is essential to our event! I also think the interface is very user-friendly and not overly complicated.,"Cons: I wish there were an easier way to do a mass photo upload for items, and I wish that items said SOLD instead of CLOSED when they are purchased outright, and that they said NOT OPEN FOR BIDDING if they are something being auctioned in the future.",Overall: It makes my online auction much easier.,

There are lots of reports available for the client as well.","Cons: There are some needed features that myself and my colleagues have requested, such as: ability to check in 2 guests at once, easier way to add credit card to guests that are already checked it, etc. Hopefully these features will be rolled out soon.",,

The ""live"" feature si amazing as well as ability to adjust prices, text messages,etc to gain funds.","Cons: That I didn't invent it. Seriously, we had user issues when we logged in as we had three administrators. Hence, when each wanted to bid, they forgot to switch to donor- an easy fix- but we missed that in training. Gesture solved it easily.",Overall: Breakout of where sales came form/who won what/I could call the winners easily.,

From an adminstrator perspective, entering items is user-friendly, the software takes much of the manual work outu of your auction and the Gesture team makes sure you're supported throughout the whole process.

The fact that there is a website that allows ANYONE to bid on auction items widens our bandwidth and allows for a much higher return. Additionally, the customer service is always impeccable.

Give Smart listens to the customer's needs and requests. The post event reporting gives us a great picture of our donors so that we can continue to make changes and adapt our events so we can raise as much money as possible.,"Cons: It would be extremely beneficial to have mailing address required on all elements of the site. Mailing address is crucial to us in order to thank our donors appropriately. This year, the Give Smart team worked with us to help us collect addresses when our guests were registering for the auction online the week leading up to the event, but we would love to see mailing address as a required field for the registration process also.",,

We did not have to follow up post event to collect from bidders who left without confirming if they had won an item. The auction results reporting saved hours of manual calculation.,"Cons: While the sign making function is a big time saver, the printed signs were not as visually impactful as those we had previously designed. The formatting could be improved.","Overall: Gesture greatly improved the productivity of our auction administration. With their great customer support, we were able to launch the software within a month of our event. By allowing guests to preregister, checkout was a breeze for guests and our staff.

The support staff were very helpful whenever I had a question. The onsite staff during the event were phenomenal and made such a difference at our event.,"Cons: Sometimes it felt too simple.

I do not have a smart phone. My husband did the bidding.,Cons: I didn't like being charged for an item that I didn't win.,"Overall: We bid on an auction item for a charity that we support. We did not win the auction item, but our credit card was charged anyway. I did not want to complain about the small amount, but was glad I did not bid more! I hope the charity got the money, but I probably won't do any bidding at the next auction.","Recommendations to other buyers: If we are being charged for just using the software, that needs to be stated up front."

Additionally, the staff support has been exceptional. Anytime I had a question they were quick to answer.","Cons: Software uses only text messages; this is prohibitive when using internationally at conventions. Would like to see e-mail. Also, the software does not feed into a CRM platform.",Overall: This software allowed me to generate thousands of dollars with limited resources and personnel.,

It holds a wealth of constituent data and we can write our own SSRS reports in-house to query this data. Support is amazing, very quick to answer any queries, and very knowledgeable about all aspects of the software. It has been relatively easy to upgrade our software/database version following the very useful documentation found on the Tessitura Network website. The TN website also features webinars, a community forum, and is packed full of information on upcoming networking events.

Tessitura also offer a Tessitura Network Express Web (TNEW) website solution for online bookings which integrates well with the Tessitura software.","Cons: Although the software itself is very customisable with custom plugins and such, it can cause headaches when upgrading to newer versions and has the potential to cause issues - these customisations must be backed up, checked for compatibility, etc. Technical support has originally been handled by agents in the US which had the potential to cause issues with time zones with our organisation being based in the UK, however they have recently restructured their support for Europe and have implemented a new helpdesk system which have helped improve this situation greatly. There are a lot of functions and features that I still feel I've barely touched on as an administrator, as well as there being a steep learning curve for end-users due to the sheer number of features available. UI elements do look a bit dated compared to other solutions on the market.","Overall: Tessitura is the lifeblood of our organisation used by our box office, marketing, and fundraising departments to store all manner of customer information. It is a powerful piece of software with many customisation options that, when configured and utilised correctly, proves a useful tool.",

Highly customizable. Integrates with many other common industry systems (mail2, Boca, etc.). Great reporting capabilities. Fantastic support documentation and staff. The user community is unparalleled in skill level, camaraderie, and enthusiasm. Ability to share an instance in a consortium environment, with advanced settings to control who can see what information.",Cons: Steep learning curve - it can be difficult to get beginner users to do much more than search for and look at records. Not the most user-friendly interface. Customizability also means the out of box product can be pretty bare bones compared to everything the software is capable of.,"Overall: Detailed data for informing managerial decisions, increased interdepartmental communication, many facets of constituent knowledge and ways to slice and dice our donorbase",

I can look up a constituent and see exactly when they came, what donations or purchases they have made, etc. The tech support is robust.","Cons: I have taken a training class in this product, have some experience in coding, and still feel like I only barely understand the basics. It is hard to learn, not intuitive at all, and has more functions than we can currently use at our size (small-mid-size museum) Plus: Expensive!","Overall: It has been hard to learn, and I frankly still don't feel confident pulling lists that my data is correct. I appreciate it's enormous capacity on the back end, but there's not a lot of front-end user options.",

There are facets for all areas of our organisation.","Cons: It is so customisable. This is an amazing feature, but comes with a lot of pitfalls and makes life challenging at upgrade time.","Overall: Tessitura is at the heart of everything we do as an organisation. It holds our customer data, we use it to manage our ticketing and website offerings, to manage Direct Debits and donations, marketing, and much more. We could not function without it.",

When I started with it, I was obviously overwhelmed, but that was tempered by it's relative ease of use, and the vast online resources available for questions that did arise.","Cons: Having used both Tessi and RE, I will say that one is much better for Box Office organizations (Tessi) than it is at housing constituent info, giving history, and basic fundraising needs. RE has robust capability for storing/targeting/querying on/exporting etc. much more so than RE.","Overall: Ease of ticketing, seating, and viewing the house. I enjoyed the option to charge directly each purchase, as opposed to batching gifts individually like I did in RE.",

There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,"Pros: The integration of ticketing with prospects/donors is alluring, esp. for performance art organizations.","Cons: This is a ticketing software with a CRM work-around built in. It's confusing, user abusive and extraordinarily expensive. In our town, NPO's had to group together, in one building, where they created a new company that specializes in Tessitura software management. It's a clever use of the software and a business structure. This company then went out and sold it's software services to other performance art organizations as far away as Los Angeles. However, all organizations can see who has who in their database. You can't go into the account, but it becomes readily apparent our prospects and donors are being hit on all the time by all the same organizations. It's tricky. But the fact remains. Tessitura is enormously complex, just to get acknowledgements out is a lot of busy work. When I came on board, the previous development person really used Tessitura as a storage unit and did all the fund raising in Excel and Word. And from a NPO business perspective, once you commit to this software, extraction is basically a blackmail. It costs a fortune to leave it and organizations still have this challenge of ticketing tied to fund raising.",Overall: Runs the entire CRM and ticketing solution for the organisation.,

It's ticketing and fundraising features are integrated and allows for a full constituent report.,"Cons: Lately, the software seems outdated.

There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,"Pros: This software has a lot of muscle power, no doubt about it. There is a lot of functionality, and every problem you come across when it comes to how to send tickets out, sending receipts to patrons, etc has a solution","Cons: 1) This software is WAY too complicated for the average theater. The learning curve is very steep, which complicates the hiring process for temporary employees (cause they never get to the point of mastery and efficiency with the software), and there is no way to edit out which functions to ""see"" on your screen. For example, if xyz theater never uses a third of the functions of the software, there should be a way to visually hide them so that employees dont get confused about what they are seeing on the screen.

2) When it comes to entering information for credit card payments, the software designers never apparently thought about how the average patron reads out their information over the phone. You have to select the type of card used before entering the card number, meanwhile the patron is halfway through spewing out their number over the phone while the ticketing office employee is scrambling to write it down on a pad of paper cause Tessie wont let them enter the number yet. If there was more flexibility in the order that information could be entered (card type then number vs number then card type), the daily functionality of the software would be much improved.",Overall: Runs the entire CRM and ticketing solution for the organisation.,

There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,Pros: Tessitura has a lot of good ticketing features. It has a great ability to customize and tracks data way better than SABO. The best part of this software is when it comes to selling subscriptions. It is really easy and user intuitive when it comes to this feature.,Cons: This software is really difficult to learn and train others on. The UI is confusing and it is difficult to find what you are looking for. The worst part of this software is how easy it is to give an order to a different patron. there are no warning signs and this has been a common problem around the office.,Overall: Overall I have not been happy with Tessitura. I feel it is far harder to use than helpful. The features it offers are great but it does not make it worth the investment.,

6430,agile ticketing,What is Agile and Why Does It Matter?,Ramya A.,ISR,11-50 employees,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Software Advice,2017-12-04,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,8.0,,"Pros: Responding to Change Perhaps the biggest advantage Agile development practices bring to development teams and businesses in general is its emphasis on responding to change and focus on working on projects that matter when they matter. Agile methods don't force us to attempt to divine the future in 9, 12, or 24-month projections. A properly-oriented Agile team has a list of the most important things they can work on; when they finish the most important thing on that list, they move to the next most important thingand so on, ad infinitum. This type of focus has many benefits: Customers get solutions to the problems they value most, sooner Stakeholders can prioritize things in a progressive fashion reflecting actual market conditions at a given time Developers feel valued, since they're working on things that actually matter and will receive frequent in-depth feedback from the very people using the product (ideally, at least). Accepting Uncertainty The second biggest source of value Agile development brings to an organization is that its practices accept the fact we don't know everything about a project when we first start.This is in stark contrast to more ""traditional"" stage-gate and waterfall approaches, where requirements are expected to be ""complete"" before anyone so much as touches a keyboard to type their first line of code. Agile instead accepts that we will discover more information as we go on; we may find a particular technical solution doesn't meet the needs of customers, or we might discover there's an entirely different problem underneath the stated problem, and by solving problem we can solve not just the proposed issue, but other customer concerns as well. Applying Agile principles to our approach allows us to accept the unknown and prioritize discovery and experimentation to drive out uncertainty before we fully commit to a solution. Faster Review Cycles In order for teams to be both accepting of uncertainty and responsive to change, there's a need for rapid iteration and cyclical, comprehensive reviews as work is completed - to ensure that new discoveries are contemplated and current efforts are evaluated. Most Agile practices either time-box efforts (Scrum) or control the amount of ""work in progress"" (Kanban) to ensure efforts are completed within a reasonable amount of time. Those efforts are then reviewed with customers or customer proxies (such as internal services teams or stakeholder teams). The focus on ensuring prompt reviews and feedback from actual users (or as close to the user as you can get) addresses the most common failings of waterfall approaches - the delivery of a product nobody really wants or likes after a 6-9 month closed development cycle. Greater Flexibility in Releasing Features In addition to faster cycles of review with customers or customer proxies, the focus on delivering working software in time-boxed or effort-boxed iterations of work provides the business as a whole more flexibility in when product should be delivered to end users. In more traditional approaches, releases occur when all the planned work is completedor, even worse, on a date set by stakeholders regardless of how polished the actual work is on that date. Agile approaches, on the other hand, provide sufficient functionality Less Up-Front Work Prior to the advent of Agile development methodologies, not only did product requirements attempt to predict what would be needed in 6-9 months, but they also attempted to be an encyclopedic contract outlining and detailing nearly every single aspect of a product's design and development. It was not uncommon to see Product Requirements Documents (""PRDs"") and Technical Requirements Documents (""Specs"") exceeding fifty or more pages and outlining specific deliverables developers would use as checklists of exactly what to deliver - nothing more and nothing less. Agile instead focuses us on defining and prioritizing problems to solve; collaborating with our developers to design, specify, and revise work needs to be done; and to exert only the amount of effort needed to move a product or project to its next phase. Incurring high up-front costs in investigation, documentation, and contract negotiation is anathematic to the fundamental beliefs outlined in the Manifesto.",Cons: Lack of Understanding Flexibility Can Lead to Bad Behaviors Culture Fit Lack of Predictability Integrating Diverse Skill Sets Into Teams Challenges at Scale,"Overall: We were able to improve the patron experience in ticket purchase and use; as well as easily train our box office team to use the product.
