Better data handling and almost 50% less costs.,"Cons: There are so many options to fine-tune your ticket sales, you need to spend some time in the dashboard","Overall: More ticketsales, more insights in where my ticketsales are coming from and a save up time and money.",
Great software,Verified Reviewer,Event Organizer,"Mental Health Care, Self-employed",Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jan 07, 2019",4,4,4,5,5,10.0,,Pros: It is very straightforward and has a very user-friendly layout. It is very clear where to put what and thus is very functional.,"Cons: If there is something wrong in the data you put or something else, a little balloon pops up in the right top corner of your screen, but it's not entirely clear that there is something wrong. That could be indicated better. Also, an auto-scroll option is missing when putting in data, e.g. when you press [tab] to go to the next field and you are at the bottom of the page, you can press [tab] as much as you want, but the fields remain out of sight.",,
