The software was easy to use and intuitive. Customer service was exemplary!,Selene M.,Publisher/Show Manager,"Media Production, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jun 18, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Flexible and easy to use software and hardware. All inclusive package options at price points we can pick. Customer service was reliable and we always had all our questions answered - if an answer was unavailable then our rep made sure to find a solution we could work with. Inexpensive and extremely competitive. We have used other software from competing vendors and honestly would recommend PurplePass before recommending other software. Lots of great programming options based on our individual needs and not so overly complicated that we need an IT degree to manipulate the software - that is the bonus! Our rep, Gabriel, was great to work with and responsive to our sometimes wacky questions.","Cons: We really liked the software as it is very competitive to other programs available on the market. The only two drawbacks we found include integration onto websites - it doesn't allow the user to stay on the website - it kept forwarding to PurplePass url. Perhaps this is due to our website software - WIX- but that was slightly annoying for our users. The other drawback is really more of a suggestion - while the software is easy to use and the search functions are great - there was not enough promotions by PurplePass for the events listed. It would be great to have a calendar of upcoming events promoted through social media or on the site itself - we found we had to ""search"" for our event and thought it would be a better selling point for PurplePass to offer ""promotions"" on the site and suggested events. Target market on social media for example.","Overall: Easy to use, functionality, competitive price, friendly and responsive reps.",
Purplepass has been awesome and had enhanced our event to be alot more effecient!,Julia K.,Sales Division Lead,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jul 18, 2018",4,5,4,5,5,10.0,,Pros: The scanners were easy to use. Since most our staff have personal iphones it was easy to use. The reporting tools is awesome because it shows a breakdown of the sales and fees which is easy to read. I like there is an option to do a seating chart and assigned seating. Also being able to make our event personalized on purplepass.,"Cons: The app felt limited. If we wanted to scan we could only be on the ""scanning mode"", if we had a walk-in attendee that needed to purchase a ticket we had to remember to change modes. I didnt like the fact that I could not see a list of all attendees admitted. Not being able to add notes on ticket holders so staff that are scanning attendees into the event are alerted when someone has a notation on their ticket",,
FTMP Events,Gregory B.,Venue Manager,"Music, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Nov 10, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Low fees for customers, no minimum sales limits for promoters, great customer service and very quick turn-around","Cons: Only thing that causes some confusion is the ticket links re-direct to a large string. Like http://www.purplepass.com/DOYLE122118 when loaded, turns into https://www.purplepass.com/#170920/FTMP_Events-DOYLE_(legendary_ex-guitarist_of_The_Misfits)-Buffalo_Iron_Works-December-21-2018.html","Overall: Purplepass has been FTMP Events' ticketing service for over 5 years, and we stick with it due to the reliability and great service.

My experience with PP compared to Ticketmaster has been hands-down more efficient and user-friendly!,Jocelyn E.,Marketing Manager,"Events Services, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Oct 25, 2017",4,5,4,5,5,8.0,,Pros: Customer Support with key account leaders for constant back and forth. Easy and accessible use of reporting. User-friendly for both the user-facing and back end. Customization of our unique product (exhibitor ticket vs. public facing ticket). Show day support. A sense of urgency for the smallest to largest issues.,"Cons: Not enough suggestions for the future based on their experiences with your product or in the event industry as a whole. I would like to see more comp or case studies provided in order to make your our experiences better. Not able to customize the 'selling widget'. Not able to capture day-of geographic data information quickly though POS, currently no data collected besides redemption during day-of.",,

Lot's of options.,"Cons: We had a few minor issues when we first started using it, but we were able to resolve them through support from PurplePass.","Overall: We are a small community theater and our initial ticketing platform was hosted on our own server. It worked fine at the beginning, but we started having many problems with it and it couldn't handle our ticketing load. So we started researching alternative ticketing solutions to implement. We tested around 10 different systems to determine what would work best for us. In the end, we chose Purplepass. Purplepass had the most features, was the easiest to implement, and was the lowest cost to operate. Whenever we had questions, Purplepass was always quick to respond and help us get the support we needed. We have been very happy using Purplepass. It has allowed us to increase our online sales and is the #1 way our customers purchase our tickets after only one season. We would highly recommend Purplepass to any organization, big or small, that is looking for a ticketing service.",
Breath of Fresh Air!,Jenn K.,Secretary,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Jun 14, 2019",5,5,4,5,4,9.0,,"Pros: I thought that it was INCREDIBLY simple to just scan the ticket and have the counts automatically generated. It made getting an accurate count for our people easier and we had NO errors!

What did you like least about this software?","Cons: From the use of the app, I can see that it is fairly primitive. There are a lot of features that I could access without issue on the website, that I could not access on the app. For the purposes of simplified scanning/ticket taking and will call checking, the app was amazing - but it would have been nice to have more depth to what I could access","Overall: This was the first event that we have held where we have utilized PurplePass for our needs. From start to finish, it has been so easy to have a smooth event. The representative we spoke with was AMAZING and made the new information so simple. The tickets that we received for our event were STUNNING and having the ability to just scan them allowed for our guests to have a nice keepsake ticket. You can't beat the price, and we received the money from our online sales a SHORT time later. I am so glad our organization found PurplePass and I can't wait to continue using it!",
Very pleased with Purplepass experience,Anupam B.,Information Technology Officer,,,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Oct 10, 2014",5,5,4,5,4,9.0,"Comments: Among a few ticketing solutions we investigated, we found Purplepass to be the most attractive from the user's perspective. Their interface to select seats simple stood out among the rest, and it super easy to configure. Our's was a special use case though, because we are membership based society which has several grades of membership. People already become members and are then given a choice of seats in their allocated zone. When we contacted Purplepass and told them our requirements, they responded back saying that it was a too complicated for their current system and that it will require them to change their internal engine to support this need. We however were very interested to go forward with this idea. At our end we created some web-services to access our data and made it available to Purplepass. Then we wrote a full requirement specification for Purplepass to implement. They started on the project a few weeks before the event and in one week or so, they had a prototype ready for us using our specification. We did some testing to make sure it met our needs, and went through a few more iterations perfecting it to an acceptable level. Note that this was done under a severe time crunch and Purplepass were very prompt in delivering our needs. We did launch a week before the event date and everyone was thrilled with the interface. As a bonus the interface also allowed the ability for members to re-allocate their seats after they have already selected their seats once. We also got thermal-printer tickets printed for the entire hall and rented scanners for box-office use. This was super easy to use. Overall I was very pleased with the experience and will use it going forward when we have big events like these.",,,,
Great customer service,Kelson H.,Coordinator,"Events Services, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Jun 18, 2019",5,5,4,5,5,8.0,,Pros: Purplepass is very customer service friendly. Their software is so easy to use for online ticket sales.,"Cons: I don't like that it is not easy to adapt for events and festivals that are not common. We are a ""unicorn"" event and there are different features we need for our events that Purplepass does not offer.","Overall: Every time I call to ask for help, Rep is so kind. He will walk me through the steps so I know what to do next time it happens. He also has walked me through all of the details for Purplepass and spent many afternoons providing training sessions with me while I learned the software. He has been a huge help. I am pleased with the software from a customer perspective, however I wish as a Promoter there were a few more features.",

Excellent customer service too!,James S.,Event Director,"Entertainment, Self-employed",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Sep 27, 2017",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: We've worked with three other ticketing vendors in the past six years, and Purple Pass is by far the best. For starters, their customer service level is amazing. They get back to you promptly, are super friendly, and work to resolve everything quickly. Their event setups are pretty detailed and customizable, and they will work with you to fine-tune things further per your event needs. Their check-in kiosks and POS check-in hand-helds are super easy to use at the gate or Registration. Events integrate great with our Word Press site and they work to customize things further if need be. Overall, just a fantastic experience.",,Overall: Ease of use.

Purple pass appears to be able to handle this well with a cloud-based environment that can sync all users instantly. It also has a relatively simple setup.","Cons: As a trial user, I can't say anything about using this software on a large scale. It appears that it would be useful, but honestly I'm just not willing to risk switching without a truly compelling reason. I did not see any such reason during setup, so I'll stick with my usual software.","Overall: Simple setup, but no significantly different features.",

Our customers told us they found it easy to purchase tickets. I found it was easy to reassign seats if the customer made a mistake and refunding was simple. The customer service is outstanding. easy to talk to, easy to reach by phone or email. Knowledgeable staff and friendly, extremely helpful from day one. Our other schools are now signing up for their shows.",Cons: I honestly could not find one thing I do not like.,Overall: Making it easier for my use as well as our ticket purchasers.

A ticketing team you can rely on!,Adam L.,Manager,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Jun 14, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Its got a learning curve that doesn't exist with your typical EventBrite-esque ticketing platform but, with very little practice the customization options and availability make it far more worthwhile than the flashier, more corporate competitors. I've never felt like I was being nickle and dimed for promoting my event and, with the proper amount of time put into designing each ticketing page, they look far more professional, enticing, and on brand with whatever you might be promoting. The ambiance required to get my audience on-board with each of my immersive experiences begins with the ticket links and it is both a satisfying and refreshing to know this is available and reliable on Purplepass.","Cons: The learning curve for the more advance options was overwhelming at first and there are sometimes setbacks when paying the listing prices back to the company but both are easily fixed and overlooked.

The lack integration with platforms such as Facebook is irritating at times as tickets cannot be listed as readily on a Facebook event or boosted post but, with some creativity and patience this, too, can be overcome.",Overall: Overall its been stellar. Far more so than the other sites I've used previously that use smaller event companies' reliance on a fancy ticketing platform to gouge extra money for capabilities that should come standard.,

It is very intuitive and smart software.,Cons: The software can be some what finicky when I try to add copy to the listing. It would be easier if cutting and pasting work more smoothly than have to play with the fonts all the time.,Overall: It's been great. Attention and service is top notch.,
PurplePass is a great value for my money and is very user friendly and efficient,Robert G.,Event Organizer,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Aug 04, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Website is easy to use, Ticket stock ships to home within a day or 2 most.

We used it at the Box Office & Gate at La Joll Festival of the Arts. The system works flawlessly !,Arman F.,Gate Co-chair,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jul 08, 2015",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,"Comments: We had a few adjustments we needed to make during the 2 day event. Gabe of Purple Pass made those adjustments immediately and kept us purring right along. We had 4 cashiers to handle the cash transactions. We had 4 shifts during the 2 days with 4 cashiers and 2-4 scanners. They were all volunteers. The touchscreens and software was intuitive and training for each shift was quick and painless. Around half of our ticket sales were on line. Those guests only had to be scanned. In the future we will need less cashiers. We had some issues with QR codes which were poorly printed and some folks who printed the receipt and not the ticket. Some folks had tickets on their smart phones and the screens were hard to read with the scanners.

Gabe was right there and immediately solved those problems and kept the guests happy. The stats which were available any time for the asking were invaluable during the event and planning for our next one. This was our 2nd year with Purple Pass. Last year the system was good but we had problems with the broadband service and credit card processing. Not a Purple Pass caused problem. The software, the touch screens and scanner were all better than last year. They keep getting better and better. I would not hesitate to recommend their system and especially the staff that supports it. Arman Freeman, La Jolla Festival of the Arts",,,,

Using the Purplepass platform helps us do that by allowing us in-house management of event ticketing and online class registration. We received excellent customer service in both endeavors. The in-person support exceeded expectations for the 2016 Taste of Temecula Valley (TOTV). PP online and phone support were outstanding for our TEF-managed registration for 2016 summer school classes. Considering we were implementing a new system, both events ran surprisingly well. I am not a technical person, but the system is very intuitive, and the tutorials are very helpful. The post-event data collection feature was an eye opener; it will be tremendously helpful as TEF looks to future marketing efforts.

Purple Pass - A Great Find!,G I.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 09, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,8.0,"Comments: This Team has what it takes to go the distance in Life. They have the key attributes of a successful enterprise. We look for relationships with people who have the Capacity and the Integrity to operate in this competitive Creative world of ours. Often times you find folks who have the Capacity (able and experienced in their craft) but, may not be totally trustworthy. On the other hand, people with the Integrity (honest with a great work ethic) may not have the knowledge and experience to perform at the levels our industry requires. So, it is refreshing to find people and Teams that exhibit both characteristics. The folks at Purple Pass, especially Brandon Foy and Gabriel personify both character traits.
