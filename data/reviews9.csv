"Well-rounded event management tool for non-profits, small, and medium businesses",Phil O.,"Team Lead, Student Recruitment and Prospective Student Centre","Higher Education, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 11, 2018",5,5,4,5,4,10.0,,"Pros: I've used Picatic across a two post-secondary institutions and with multiple non-profit groups. Picatic provides flexible and easy-to-use tools to handle registrations, check-ins, payments, and communication for your event. The crux of the system is in the ability to quickly create an attractive and responsive basic event registration in very little time. The ability to collect robust, custom information from clients is very helpful. Recently-added capacities to work in teams/groups and to manage events with multiple dates are very welcome. Support staff are quick and helpful.","Cons: Some of what makes the software the simplest/friendliest also causes some restrictions - i.e. the survey tool is limited in its configuration options meaning you cannot structure/validate the data, or the multiple parties cannot register together (parent with child, spouse with spouse).","Overall: This software provides a single tool for our department of four to create, administer, and market events to our clients and prospective market.",
Easy to use ticketing product with a very reasonable price tag,Amanda G.,"Director, Brand Design","Automotive, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: GetApp,"Mar 24, 2016",5,5,4,5,4,10.0,"Comments: Our company needed registration for two different types of events, a race/rally and a tour. Being completely new to the event space, we didn't realize how useful the management tools would be. The attendee lists, analytics, and email tools were crucial. In addition, Picatic's interface is really user-friendly. Our team had varying degrees of computer skill, and no one had a problem navigating the management tools. We required support to issue a complicated refund, their support team was prompt and friendly when dealing with our team and customer. Overall we've had a great experience with Picatic's product and team.","Pros: As mentioned, the management tools were a huge asset to our event. Now that we've used them we'd have a hard time living without downloadable entrance lists, attendee surveys, Google analytics, and Mailchimp integration. Picatic's interface is also really nice, it was user-friendly and intuitive.",Cons: There are a few features missing. (I understand that start-ups need to start somewhere and build up) We would love the ability to add time zones and close an even early. We would love to take advantage of their API for future events - a more seamless check-out that looks like part of our website will be really beneficial.,,

The Picatic interface is very easy to use and we have always had great customer service.,Michelle B.,branch executive member,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 14, 2018",5,5,5,5,4,10.0,,Pros: I love how easy it is to manage our events through the website. We can gather all the information we need through the surveys and the Picatic collects everything into useful reports that we can download and save. This cuts down on the need to go back and forth by email with registrants.,"Cons: In the past we have had some trouble with cutoff times between early-bird and regular ticket sales, but the Picatic team was very responsive and have made changes to address this. We found this aspect easier to navigate with recent events.",,
Picatic is Great!,Gabriella B.,,,Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: GetApp,"Apr 05, 2016",5,5,5,5,4,10.0,"Comments: I have used Picatic for 2 events now (one Halloween Fundraising Event and one to ticket an Independent Film screening), and I absolutely love the service. The main appeal for me is its user friendly interface and customizable nature. For both events, I have been able to set up very aesthetically pleasing pages with custom graphics, posters and videos. I also very much appreciate that all customer information is collected and a guest list is complied for you.",Pros: -There is always support available if you run into troubles. I personally have rarely needed to use the customer support because the set up process is very easy to follow. - Donation feature and customer survey features are great additions to the regular ticketing app. - Visual customization easily done.,"Cons: - When loading a video onto your page, I noticed that it can only appear at the top of the page. It would be cool to be able to imbed this anywhere on the page, just like you can imbed photos.",,
A classic site for ticketing.,Verified Reviewer,,,Source: Capterra,NO,Source: GetApp,"May 11, 2018",4,5,4,5,3,8.0,,Pros: It is easy to use this system. It is great it has different features available. A big pro is that Picatic is always innovating new features for a better customer experience.,Cons: The price has increased significantly over the past few years. This has been a challenge for our nonprofit organization that does not make as much money as a hospital foundation or foodbank so it is posing a challenge that could eventually direct us elsewhere.,"Overall: The features are ample for a good ticketing site, and the customer service is really good.",
Great Canadian Product for Events,Jane Ellen F.,Owner,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jun 29, 2015",4,5,4,5,3,8.0,"Comments: It is awesome that a Canadian company has come up with a way to give events a free service. Setting up tickets & the ticket website was very easy. One does not need to know any coding language making this a very appealing system to volunteer/charitable groups. If you are in need of a simple system, this is an event ticket system for you. I would highly recommend it to volunteer/charitable groups running an event that need a simple registration system with a ticket output. I personally look forward to the system evolving. Currently the additional fields answers download in a separate report known as ""Guest Surveys"", thus having to merge the entrance list and guest survey list together for a complete report - if you are not good at excel, this would be a hindrance. As well, you can't run multiple events, with different bank accounts, under one Picatic account. As an event planner who has multiple clients, with multiple events, this means running multiple accounts and is inconvenient. All in all, it is a great system that just needs some time to evolve. I love getting my weekly sales reports in my inbox - I don't have to go into the system to see how the tickets are selling. Thank you Picatic - I can't wait to see what you do next!",,,,

Can pay for multiple ""tickets"" at one time. For the most part was user-friendly for the attendees when registering, although a few did have difficulties with payment.","Cons: Not as user-friendly as I hoped. Had to contact CS frequently because the process to make things active was not super self-explanatory. Event attendees did get confused as to if they had to bring their ""tickets"" to the event.",,
"Easy to use platform, visually pleasing, more functionality than other ticketing sites",Nashelley K.,Senior Manager,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 11, 2018",5,5,4,5,3,5.0,,"Pros: Easy to use, easy to integrate onto website; good flexibility in design; customer service team is quick to help","Cons: Some limitations in the functionality, but Picatic may already be working to remedy these - front of mind is that with promo codes, we can't limit the number of tickets that can be purchased with that code, we can only limit the number of tickets that can be purchased per ticket type... would like more flexibility with codes and ticket types. I'd also like to be able to view full lists, which promo code was applied, and reorder the lists online rather than having to download each time.",,
I've used a variety of ticketing systems this is the most flexible while being easy to use.,Dave M.,Consultant,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 11, 2018",5,5,5,4,5,10.0,,Pros: I run a series of festivals and always need different ticket pricing tiers and discounts. This system makes that really easy to do.,"Cons: Could be some better exporting of sales for accounting. The door reports are great, but I'd like to export out a summary of sales for reporting to stakeholders and export transactions to an accounting system.",Overall: I've sold a lot of tickets to events through this system. It is my go-to ticketing system these days.,
"I've enjoyed some of the feature as the ticket designer, but our customers have had many issues.",Sara P.,Director of Online Operations & Media,"Education Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 13, 2018",3,2,2,4,3,3.0,,"Pros: I like the sleek, professional look of Picatic. I like that it easily integrates with our website. I've had helpful customer service.","Cons: I don't like that it makes me create the same survey every time I make a new ticket. I don't like that to pay with an invoice customers have to click ""OFFLINE"", which is very confusing and often unclear that this option will allow them to do an invoice. I don't like that I can't customize the email or the invoice that goes out to customers after they've bought a ticket. I don't like how much time I've spent manually putting in customer information because so many of them have had trouble using this product. :(",Overall: Using this product helped me learn what features I truly need and am looking for in a ticketing service so that I could make an informed decision on the next company we choose.,
Reliable platform for hosting events - looks great and gaining traction.,Bonnie F.,Chief Investment Innovator,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jun 02, 2018",4,4,4,4,4,10.0,,Pros: Easy to use and looks great. Great user interface for both event creators and for event attendees. Happy to use a made-in-Canada solution for my local events.,Cons: Doesn't have the same level of adoption in US and UK (where I have hosted events before). My audience/attendees in those geographies are still more familiar with registering for events via Eventbrite.,"Overall: Easy to use for free and paid events, easy to manage RSVP list.",
Easy to Get Up and Running Quickly,Sabrina B.,Founder | Consultant,Human Resources,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 11, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Picatic is very user-friendly and easy to set up quickly. Its fees are less than similar sites.

It took a few minutes to set up the event and start selling tickets. The layout looked great as well! Being able to link between our site and the event page was also very useful.,"Cons: We had a few issues with attendees unable to process payment for tickets, that may have been on the bank's side but still made selling tickets a bit more complicated. Support replied to requests in a timely fashion to help us deal with any issues though.",,

Prefer the look and feel a lot more than Eventbrite. Also, it feels a lot more white label in its design.","Cons: Lack of customisation is very limiting. Colours, labels, buttons, etc. They really have room to improve in customisaton. Also, I find it very annoying that they don't have support 24/7/365",Overall: Go implementation for WordPress and one off events.,
Utilizing Picatic as a non-event service,B W.,Director,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Apr 10, 2015",5,4,4,5,3,8.0,"Comments: Robbie has been great in working with me to use the service for our business card ordering model.

Customer Service response time is fast with excellent follow-up from our representative. Our issues were handled with high priority and quickly resolved.,"Cons: I would love to have more editing capabilities and more diverse survey options.

An excellent product for simple events.,Lynda T.,"Director, Lecturer and Business Owner",,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 11, 2018",4,5,3,5,4,9.0,,Pros: Very easy to use and set-up. Visually attractive and delegates found it easy to navigate to make bookings,"Cons: No option to provide partial refunds through Picatic in the case of a cancellation fee being deducted. A place is not reserved until the purchase is complete. This caused us problems with a fast-selling event in that delegates had the ticket but by the time they completed checkout, the ticket had gone to someone else who could type faster.",,
Great service that I have used for 3+ events,Verified Reviewer,"Director, Lecturer and Business Owner","Internet, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 15, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: The interface is really user-friendly and makes throwing an event really simple.

Picatic has given me the ability to have my attendees register right from our website.,Joan S.,Owner,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jan 07, 2016",4,4,5,4,5,10.0,"Comments: The leaning curve was a little difficult when I first started but now I feel comfortable. I just started using the Pro features and so far I like them.

The one thing I discussed with Robbie was the issue of offering Early Purchase discounts and his suggestion was to create multiple pages so that when the deadline for one was over the new one would be in effect. Other than that I really have not had problems with your products.

I have noticed that you now have a setup to offer clients your own processing of credit cards. One of the reasons I choose Strip was the instant payments into my account. My small business does not have sufficient cash flow to pay vendors upfront, if I have to wait for the money until after the event is over. I feel this may be an issue with small companies like my self.

I teach continuing education classes and adding classes to your list of options for what the event is doing would be a nice little addition.",,,,

- Creates a shareable link which makes it easy to send to potential attendees

It would be nice to be able to multi-select and delete dates in this setting. A small annoyance for an otherwise great platform.","Overall: It's time savings. It's well laid out, and just functions properly. I want to be able to quickly create an event, and sell tickets.

Very good,Karen F.,Minister,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 02, 2016",4,4,4,5,4,9.0,"Comments: Great product.

For the most part, easy to learn and use.

Customer service is excellent.

A couple of pointers would have made for a better experience first time through:

- before I can click on ""live"" let me know what i *can't* change once its live i.e. web address

- more clarity about pricing ... i felt that i had to do some searching to figure out what my ticket price would be, and whether I needed pro or not, and what I would need to purchase (in addition to picatic) to be able to charge for events.

One very minor bugs:

- in the event information panel, when I click on country, and then move my cursor to the next line, the country changes. This has happened with each of the four events I've made. I've discovered the workaround is to fill in the city first, then the country then the province i.e. not the order you've got them on the page.

My only regret is that we should have started earlier. The team at Picatic is responsive - even when dealing with a small family music project like ours.

Working with Picatic allows us to focus on actually hosting concerts rather than having to deal with all of the minutia related to ticket sales.
