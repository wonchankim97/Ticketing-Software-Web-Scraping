Exceptional customer service

Training for ticketing was easy to understand and communicated thoroughly

Any questions were answered promptly

Timely deposits sent electronically

Reports can be configured in numerous formats - unable to do manually with such large attendance.

Ability to focus on VIP guests efficiently

Able to block and unblock tickets easily

Loved the daily updates -one can use those numbers to plan sales for next year - see if running ahead or behind.",Cons: Would like a report that shows quickly the tickets sold by price point without having to compute it manually,"Overall: I loved working with Matt on our event. He was enthusiastic and such a great support to me. All questions and concerns were responded to quickly and with such joy. I think Showclix is very lucky to have him as an account manager. He understands the needs of his client and customers. I look forward to working with Showclix next year on the very large event. We ticketd over 1500 people and everyone was thrilled to have their reservation so easily.

Thank you Showclix",

showclix - event ticketing,Showclix,Lance R.,Owner,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Sep 18, 2009",5,5,nan,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: The ticket purchase system is one of the best I have seen.

The staff is so helpful and quick with any needs you have.

The report section of ticket sales is very helpful to us and we use it on a daily basis.

One other thing that was very helpful to us was the fact that Showclix was able to send out an email blast to all our previous customers announcing new shows. Great Networking!

And of course Josh is the best!","Cons: Some clients have complained about the time they have to purchase tickets. It seems that they have been kicked out of the system if they do not make their purchase in a set amount of time.

ShowClix featured our brand so well on our ticketing page, that customers thought that the ticketing page was part of our site. The setup was complete, with design elements in place, in no time at all.","Cons: Our ticketing process was a bit rushed, given circumstances on our end. As such, training on the system that will surely help optimized working with the features available, wasn't something we paid much attention to mastering. This isn't as much a con as it is an opportunity to incorporate in the future with other events.","Overall: ShowClix is a wonderful partner for giving an event more punch, personality and customization. The team there will help identify ways to work with the specific needs for any event. And the fees are fair.",
