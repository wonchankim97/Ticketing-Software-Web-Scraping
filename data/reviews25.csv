A process that seems to keep improving with new functionality as we ourselves develop.,Meg T.,Events Coordinator,"Events Services, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 19, 2017",4,4,4,4,3,8.0,,"Pros: I like that it keeps developing and growing with the customers and their needs. I love that they are open to feed back and take it seriously and work to make things better each year for the customers so the customers can make everyone happier such as the administrators, users, and registrants.","Cons: I wish we could upload photos more and add to any text areas instead of linking them. Also, wish we could create a seating or vendor layout that would be visual for the registrants where they could click on it to select a seat or a booth space they want to purchase. Additionally, created the option to have a 2 step process of registration involved where registrants can be approved first and then they can pay fee. We make this happen ourselves by manipulating the database for us and utilizing the code feature to unlock payments. But, it would be neat if when they applied or registered then administrators would run a report and then check a box beside all the registrants to approve and then it sends an approval email to them. This would make it simple instead of going into each of the 300 profiles and marking a custom field in their schedule. so many steps to approve someone. Each one takes like several screens. If there were any easier way to do this that would be amazing.",Overall: It really helps me to keep all of my registrants organized for different events. As well as my volunteer lists for events.,
This is a great software for volunteer events,Amy S.,Volunteer Director,"Sports, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 28, 2017",4,4,3,5,4,9.0,,"Pros: Ease of use to register on both the front end and the back end. If there are any items that need to be addressed, customer support is always excellent. The features they continue to add on are terrific.","Cons: There are some items I wish it had, but have not been developed yet such as a person being blocked from adding an invalid email. I also wish they would bring back the blocking emails from registering (maybe because the volunteer was not a right fit or they were banned for whatever reason). I also wish we would be able to download and/or contact all registrants in the system, not just by individual site. This would prevent some volunteers from receiving the same email (if they are registered for multiple sites) and would be less time for the administrator in sending out multiple emails for multiple sites.","Overall: We have been utilizing TRS for 5 years and the system keeps getting better. Customer support is outstanding and Customer support representative is an absolute joy to work with. They listen to suggestions and take into consideration items to improve on, though I know they are unable to accommodate all requests.","Recommendations to other buyers: I think, if they have not done so already, create a ""task force"" team to help create/develop new features based on the needs of the various organizations they work with. They could do a call every quarter or twice a year just to discuss trends and wish lists TRS may not have thought of."
"Easy to use, great customer service, very user friendly",Becky G.,Programming and Event Coordinator,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 02, 2018",5,4,5,5,4,9.0,,"Pros: I like how you are able to clone previous sites to make it easier for me to update dates and any smaller position changes that occur with events that happen each year. The capabilities of the site seem very repetitive with adding shifts, customizing selections, etc, which makes building the site that much easier for me. The customer service with Flory and her team are top notch! They are always willing to answer questions and the follow up truly helps build the relationship with our team and theirs. Overall, I have had a very positive and great experience using the software!","Cons: Occasionally I run into the issue of the site not being as customizable for the event as it could be. For example, if I am running an event that only has one registrant type, it seems like there should be an option for users to go right to selecting activities. It is not horrible to not take this extra step of creating this one registrant type on the page, but seems that it could be more user friendly by having this be an option on the back end.",,
"TRS user/administrator for the last 4 years. As a company, we use TRS for 3+ events per year.",Meagan B.,COO,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 02, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: That we can customize it to do what we need. We use TRS for both volunteer and vendor management. Works best for volunteer management, but is best option for the price for vendor management.",Cons: Would like better integration with our own existing websites for each individual site - ie co-branding capabilities beyond just the header banners.,"Overall: We use this software to manage our online applications for both vendors and volunteers for all of our live events. This product is used for 3 or more events per year, so our staff is very familiar with how TRS operates.",
"It has been positive, it offers most everything I need and seems to have a pretty good delivery rate",Jessica H.,Volunteer Program Manager,"Events Services, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 20, 2017",4,3,4,4,4,8.0,,Pros: I like that volunteers can register for multiple events at once and that it now has texting available.,"Cons: Sometimes I still think the process for the volunteers can be difficult, I still hear from people having trouble. Sometimes I cannot pull all reports I would like to.","Overall: I am able to allow all volunteers to register for the activities and events of their choice, it's makes management much easier for me as the volunteer coordinator.",
I've grown accustomed to using myTRS and find it works well for my clients' needs.,Tina M.,president,"Events Services, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 19, 2017",5,5,4,3,5,8.0,,Pros: I like that it's a local company owned by someone I know and I've used this product enough that I'm pretty familiar with it.,Cons: I would like to see myTRS return to the account manager customer service model. I miss having Tammy to reach out to for questions or help with one-off issues. I don't find the FAQ very helpful nor the support email as quick to response as I would like.,,
TRS has been a great experience and continues to be,Karen C.,Volunteer admin,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 29, 2017",4,4,3,4,5,8.0,,Pros: The software is user friendly and easy to use in the admin side. It also is beneficial that our template can be copied and pasted each year and I only have to add shift times and dates for each of my locations,Cons: It would be beneficial if the software had the capability to send automatic reminders to volunteers,,
Always Impressed with myTRS,Chelsea K.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 28, 2017",4,4,4,5,5,8.0,"Comments: I have been using myTRS for a variety of different large events since 2013 and have always been a fan of this management site. Specifically, I have used it for volunteer management and have really enjoyed seeing the positive changes that have been made over the years to make it easier for both us on the management side and the front end for the volunteers to sign up. Not only is it simple and easy to get set up and manage, I have had some of the best customer service and working relationship with myTRS when working and managing sites. I always know that if I have questions, I can send a quick email or set up a call and I will have a response quickly.",,,,
Using TRS for client events,Mona F.,Owner,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 28, 2013",5,5,4,5,5,8.0,,"Pros: User interface for constiuents and volunteers to register is simple and attractive. Custom field features allow me to create additional fields for management use that are not visible to registrants. The ease with which it exports to MS Excel makes it possible to quickly merge more elaborate letters, invoices, reports, etc. created in MS Word. Search/Advance Search function easy to use for building queries. Email function easy to use and allows for easy segmentation of database for communication.","Cons: Financial reports are a great resource for those needing basic information, but could be enhanced for those more engaged in financial managment of an event including reconciliation. Would like a new feature allowing reapplying payments when registrants change selected activities with the same or different prices. Despite lack of these advanced financial features for financial managers, I still rate TRS 5 stars in feature reachness because it meets or exceeds the registration features that most event managers need.","Overall: With nearly 25 years in nonprofit management and event management, this is the best product I have found for ease of use for event managers and registrants/volunteers, custom field flexibility, report flexibility, and more.",
Concessions Coordinator,Karen C.,Concessions/Volunteer Coordinator,"Sports, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 28, 2017",4,4,4,4,4,8.0,,Pros: Easy to use and maintain,Cons: That the system doesn't send out reminders - I do manually.,Overall: The TRS system is easy to use and maintain for reaching out to our volunteers and for our volunteers to sign up for their concession shifts throughout the sport seasons.,Recommendations to other buyers: not at this time
TRS is very easy to use!,Ashley J.,Account Manager,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 13, 2017",5,5,5,5,4,8.0,,"Pros: It's very user friendly! Since the system is very user friendly, it's great to use at any size conference. It's easy to pull reports for registration. It's also great if the same registrants attend the same conference every year, as the system will keep the information and you can easily register each time.","Cons: Really nothing to complain about. There could be incomplete registrations if the registrant doesn't go till the end and unfortunately, the system doesn't show that their registration is incomplete. The registrant just doesn't receive the confirmation email to show them they are completely signed up.",,
From CLIENT to EMPLOYEE,Joelle B.,Account Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 04, 2013",5,5,5,5,4,8.0,,"Pros: Before working at TRS, I was a client using the product. I was a Volunteer Manager for over 7000 volunteers and my first year we were using excel spreadsheets. TRS saved my life! I became efficient - knowing exactly who signed up for what shift, knowing where we were short volunteers, being able to track attendance, communicating with volunteers by event or shift because we actually got volunteers' email addresses!

Being able to actually pull reports before, during and after the event made me more effective as a volunteer manager.

Loved the 'include itinerary' option to always remind volunteers what they registered for!",Cons: Would like to see the reporting become more robust where you can set even more specific parameters and even pull some sort of a daily report of activity.,"Overall: TRS allowed me to actually start managing my volunteers and my volunteer program instead of being stuck behind a desk swamped with admin work. It also made me more organized and helped better our volunteer program changing the mindset from 'we desperately need volunteers' to 'if you want to volunteer with us, you have to follow these rules'. I believe so much in the product that when the opportunity arose, I started working for TRS!",
Great customer service. Easy to create the site.,Morgan S.,Volunteer Coordinator,"Sports, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"May 01, 2017",5,4,4,5,5,10.0,,Pros: The excel upload function is the best. It is very easy to create the volunteer sites and customize everything to the event itself. I love the reports that are available as well.,"Cons: It would be nice to have people use the same email address if they are in the same family. I have had quite a few people call and ask if they need to create a different email for themselves to sign up. Also, the activities are expanded underneath the activity groups so that might be nice to have not expanded. It takes a while to create an activity in the activity maker, it is much easier to do it in excel. Maybe instead of choose the month and day you could type it in instead?",Overall: Quick and easy registration site.,
Great for organizing large groups of Volunteers!,Beth B.,Assistant Director,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Aug 11, 2015",4,5,4,5,5,10.0,"Comments: 2015 marked the first year that we used TRS to register and manage Volunteers for VeloSano, a community fundraiser and cycling event for cancer research at Cleveland Clinic (www.velosano.org). In this, our second year, we had over 900 Volunteers filling over 1,100 shifts.",,,,
Columbus Indiana Visitors Center Review,Eric M.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 28, 2017",4,4,4,5,5,8.0,,"Pros: I like the setup for volunteer sign-up, check-in and reports and am thrilled that text messaging has been added to the communications component of the system.",Cons: The email function could definitely improve. It would be nice to be able to send test emails or save drafts and come back to an email later. There is also a problem with the formatting of our banner when an email is sent. We have followed the size specifications but the image is distorted when it is sent.,"Overall: Working with the TRS product has been very positive for our organization. Most importantly they continue to make changes and updates that benefit the end user. As with anything, there is room for improvement but the overall product is very good and cost effective.","Recommendations to other buyers: Simplifying the group sign-up feature would be helpful. And, when a volunteer signs up, the country and state drop downs are a little irritating."
Used TRS for 3 years for two large conventions,Rose Z.,Visitor Services Coordinator,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 26, 2016",5,5,4,5,5,8.0,"Comments: I first started using TRS for the National FFA Convention that we had in Louisville, KY from 2013-2015. It was required by the Convention to use this program and I can understand why because it was so easy to maintain so many volunteer shifts with so many volunteers (20+ different volunteer jobs and around 200 volunteers, each year!). We were able to check-in volunteers when they arrived at their shifts, run reports (daily schedule, personal itineraries for volunteer packets, and final volunteer totals, etc).",,,,
Great product for volunteers!,Marcie L.,Operations Manager,"Events Services, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 07, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Registration reports, custom features, customer service",Cons: Nothing so far - I wish I had more time to explore and experiment with the different reports and features.,Overall: Currently working on our second registration site for volunteers and would recommend TRS to anyone planning a large event with staff or volunteers. It's very user-friendly and designed specifically for volunteer management.,
A Great System that Kept Us Together,Kelsey E.,Volunteer Coordinator,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 22, 2014",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,Comments: TRS is a great company to work with. The Canadian Tulip Festival was in need of a volunteer registration system that would allow more time for volunteer management and less time spent scheduling volunteers in a spreadsheet. TRS truly delivered on that front. Our Account Manager was terrific and provided us with a lot of support on every level. The system was down for a few minutes one day but was fixed before I could even finish responding to their tech support message.,,,,
TRS provides high quality volunteer management system and stellar service,Katie Z.,Executive Director,"Consumer Services, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 02, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: The ability for an organization to manage an event, whether large or small.",,"Overall: We are a partner of TRS and have worked closely with them to onboard thousands of volunteers for many, many events, including some very high profile events. From working with TRS to build the initial integration to continuing to onboard clients using our turnkey integration, we have found that TRS support is truly stellar. Our clients love the solution and their software allows clients to successfully manage their event. We've noticed that clients continue to refer TRS to other clients and those that have events each year continue to recommend TRS to the new event committee. We're proud to be associated with such a quality product and organization.",Recommendations to other buyers: The best event management software I have seen.
It has been amazing.,Jerrell P.,Assistant Director,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 20, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,9.0,,Pros: The functionality is very easy. It is very user friendly. I am able to access the site from anywhere.,"Cons: Would be amazing if it were more interactive or could be dressed up a little more (add video content, etc.).",,
Exactly what we need!,Gary C.,Senior Director of Sports,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 14, 2014",4,5,5,5,5,9.0,"Comments: As a volunteer driven organization we need to be sure we are able to register, track and communicate well with our volunteers. Having TRS makes us more organized and efficient and professional. We are still learning the ins and outs of TRS but with the constant support of Tammy and her knowledge of how to make it work for our organization I always feel good that there is no issue we cannot resolve (and there have been very few issues).",,,,
"TRS - Great Product, Great Service",Valerie G.,Sr. Program & Events Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 22, 2014",5,5,5,5,5,9.0,Comments: The 500 Festival has utilized TRS since 2008 and have continuously been impressed with the customer service and the product. It is easy to use from an outsiders perspective and is very user-friendly on the back-end.,,,,
Love working with TRS,Franziska S.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 28, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: easy handling, you can almost teach yourself everything, but if not the customer service is very good and fast","Cons: Late integration with Verified Volunteers; it was not as easy as it sounded, always make sure to start the background check integration as soon as you go live with TRS","Overall: This is my first time using The Registration System to recruit volunteers for a big event. From the beginning, the customer support was amazing, whenever I needed help with something I got immediate response. The handling of the system is very easy and you can almost teach yourself all the different areas of the website. It is just a great tool to use for volunteer recruitment, especially with all their new features they are adding almost on a weekly basis.

Thank you for making the volunteer recruitment so much easier. I love working with TRS",Recommendations to other buyers: Always start the background check integration as soon as you go live with your site!
It's been great working with TRS. They're always accessible and have made things easy for us!,Davon R.,"Assoc. Director, Football & Basketball Operations",,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 19, 2017",4,4,4,5,5,10.0,,Pros: The amount of work it takes off of our hands. We use it for volunteer registration and the fact that everything is online makes it a smooth operation for our office as well as our volunteers.,Cons: There are a few rare occasions when a volunteer can slip through the cracks without completing all of the required information.,,
Customization,Emma M.,Associate,"Events Services, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 08, 2017",4,4,4,5,5,9.0,,Pros: Very easy to use,Cons: Not as customizable as I would like.,"Overall: The system is fairly easy to use on both the back and front ends. The best improvement would be to add more customizable features. Over my experience with FFA, I have expressed my ideas with various TRS employees. Colors of website and button verbiage would be at the top of the list.",
Run with TRS,Gee L.,volunteer coordinator,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 05, 2013",4,5,4,5,5,9.0,,Pros: TRS gives the user/administrator total access and thereby control over his/her event. You are able to build out your event exactly the way you envision it - you decide what data/information is important to your event.,"Cons: I wish there was a ""spell check"" tool so I wouldn't have to ""cut/paste"" from a word document.",Overall: I have not found anything as good as TRS on the market.,
CDLC Fundraiser,Kimberly H.,Staff Attorney,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 14, 2013",4,5,4,5,5,9.0,,Pros: We could track all of the invitees to the fundraiser; we could easily send out event reminder e-mails to everyone at one time; we were able to pull up reports effortlessly; and TRS gave our fundraiser a polished look.,Cons: Some people coming to the fundraiser didn't want to have to register/give email addresses. (Most fundraisers don't require this).,Overall: I would highly recommend TRS. It is a quality product. We used it in an unconventional manner which created hiccups. I was so grateful for the easily generated reports which helped make grant compliance easier and having all the donor data in one place in preparation for our next solicitation.,
Wonderful registration system,Kelci D.,Project Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 05, 2013",4,5,4,5,5,9.0,,Pros: The Registration System is a fantastic tool to manage volunteers. It's extremely easy to learn how to use the system and it's very easy for your patrons as well. It's also great for repeat events since you can duplicate the site from year to year. It saves a lot of time and decreases error. The site provides many easy ways to pull reports and view patrons that have registered and selected shifts.,"Cons: Occasionally I would like to contact registrants with certain stipulations, however, the site does not allow you to make certain distinctions when contacting groups of people.",Overall: TRS is a perfect tool for volunteer management. The creation and management of the site makes overseeing volunteers a breeze. The staff is readily available to assist with any obstacles and patrons find the site easy to navigate and understand.,
"Easy, Flexible, and Concise",Savannah L.,Nanny,,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 27, 2017",4,5,5,5,5,9.0,,Pros: I enjoy the streamlined functionality of website creation without having to know and implement actual website coding,"Cons: As certain classes and sessions needed to be changed, due to external factors, some individuals who were registered for those classes were then kicked out without updating their final schedule. We had several attendees who were following their confirmation email but the printed final schedule at the registration desk may have only included one of their actual classes and not the new or updated schedule. To combat this, I'd say that there would need to be minimal to no changes to the site or schedule after making the website go live.",,
"Great product, fantastic customer service!",Liam G.,Volunteer Coordinator,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 18, 2014",4,3,5,5,5,9.0,"Comments: I have had the opportunity to work with TRS closely over the past year. The biggest hurdle that I have found with the system, is that it is not user-intuitive and is difficult to navigate. That being said, the customer service that TRS provides is outstanding. My customer service representative is able to teach me how to use the system in a clear and concise manner. She answers every questions I have and is able to help me through any issue I have while using the website. I would have an email response with 24 hours, and am able to call with any questions I may have to get a more thorough response. Despite the difficulty of learning how to navigate the website, I would recommend TRS to anyone, especially those with a large volunteer base. Once you learn how to navigate the site, it is easy to customize the site to your specific needs. I can't imagine using a different product, as TRS has proved itself to be a huge asset to my organization.",,,,
GCSC Review of TRS,Becky G.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 16, 2017",4,5,4,5,5,9.0,"Comments: As an organization, we have been using TRS for several years, even thought I recently jumped onboard to use about 1.5 years ago. I love that it is so user friendly and they are constantly making improvements to the site. Flory and her team are fantastic and always there if we have questions or need something explained a bit further. We use the program for multiple events each year, and it is very nice that you can duplicate a site from year to year with much of the same data still included. This saves time on the set-up of a brand new site and allows our team to focus on other areas. I would highly recommend TRS to other organizations looking for a new, user friendly, and engaging site for volunteer management.",,,,
I have just started using TRS and the staff has been great with assisting me.,Erika M.,Volunteer Program Coordinator,,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 04, 2018",4,4,4,5,4,9.0,,Pros: I like all that you can do with the software. You can really customize it to make it your own. this makes it very easy to customize to each of our events.,"Cons: Since there is so much customization some parts can be a little confusing, but it is easy to go through and figure out or ask for assistance.",,
"Very easy to use, especially easy to follow when building the site. Very customizable.",Morgan G.,Events Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Oct 13, 2015",5,4,4,5,4,9.0,"Comments: I have been using TRS for three years now and 2015 was the first year for myTRS. myTRS has been a significant improvement on an already great software. The site is easy to navigate with a logical flow of tabs and headers. We have struggled in the past with the reporting not being as customizable as our event requires, but any reporting issues were solved with the new software. Our event is very complex and spans several days with several events built in. myTRS is able to accommodate our specific data needs without hassle. Any small glitches that came up as a result of either user or technological error were met with great customer service and clear answers to our questions for quick problem solving.",,,,
TRS to the rescue,Tyler S.,Project manager,"Events Services, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 12, 2019",5,4,4,5,4,8.0,,"Pros: The ability to track hundreds and thousands volunteers times, roles, responsibilities is game changing. It has helped us on many events track the volunteers we have and use.",Cons: At times it can be clunky and thought to get around but I've yet to find a better option,,
TRS - The Registration System,Wendy H.,Special Events Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 18, 2014",5,5,4,5,4,8.0,"Comments: TRS is priceless. It is like an extra staff member. It compiles all of the information and keeps it all in one place for when I need it. It does so much more than just volunteers. My entire festival from food vendors to art vendors all register with this system. I can communicate to the each group individually with the click of a button and even attach a file. I can change/add and delete things as needed without having to involve someone from the company, but if I run into a challenge they are always there to help! A++++ product. It is priceless for this event staff of almight ONE!",,,,
For the most part it is a very easy platform to use.,Josh S.,Director,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 19, 2017",4,4,4,5,4,9.0,,Pros: Ease of use of it. Setting up in the back end is pretty straight forward with a lot of great features.,Cons: Running reports. It was kind of confusing to pull exactly what I wanted from the user reports. Kind of clunky.,Overall: Being able to gauge our volunteer interest.,
Lacking ease for user but cost effective and has the basics,Bridget K.,Center Coordintor,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 28, 2017",2,1,2,2,4,1.0,,"Pros: Low cost

Easy to process or look up files","Cons: Can't link to our website URL or imbed registration

Confusing steps for registrants

Have to contact TRS for making new pages

Group registrations is confusing

Very simple - limited functionality","Overall: Users have a lot of difficulty with the user friendly experience, particularly as the link to register takes them off our website and does not link back to the website. A few other glitches and questions with following the steps and popups. However, it's fairly easy to configure and TRS does reply to our emails. The low cost is the major reason we're using this service.",
Great for Registering Young Volunteers!,Carla P.,Volunteer Coordinator,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 18, 2014",5,4,2,5,4,1.0,"Comments: Our free art festival uses about 525 volunteers, many of them under 18. TRS was chosen 3 years ago because we could set it up to require a parent or guardian signature for those under 18. The support is great and we volunteered to be one of the first organizations to try out their redesigned streamlined system, new this year. We also checked out quite a few other similar packages this past spring, and decided to stay with TRS because it was still the most comprehensive volunteer management suite.",,,,
Helps events run super smoothly!,Chelsea M.,Social Media Coodinator,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 26, 2018",5,3,5,5,4,1.0,,Pros: It's so nice to be able to copy pages and events without much hassle. The best events I've worked on have used this.,Cons: Sometimes it can be a little confusing especially for newbies. But customer support has never been an issue and now I'm a pro.,,
Integration with myTRS Platform,Sanjiv T.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 28, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,Comments: Xceede Solutions works with myTRS on various integration projects with Salesforce CRM.

TRS,Tina M.,President,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 17, 2014",4,4,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: I like having access to the data, reports, etc in TRS but find it sometimes to be a bit cumbersome in setting it up. It takes a great deal of time to load everything in and test it before going ""live."" It's not a program that I can pass along to a staff member without either training them myself or having them go through training.

I like the staff and appreciate their responsive nature to any question I have.",,,,
Great Volunteer Registration System,Christine P.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 09, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: Great and simple to use volunteer registration program.
