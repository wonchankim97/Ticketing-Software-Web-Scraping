At the time, the system was relatively basic and not well equipped to host a show with a booking period of longer than about a month but we have worked together over the last year to add and enhance features within the system and the guys have been so open-minded and accommodating of my millions of requests! They are always on the end of the phone or email to help and to pitch in if I need something urgently. I would already recommend the system as it is but can happily say that it is only going to continue improving.",
