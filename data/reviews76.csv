rezware xp7,Tour Reservation & Food Sales System,Kim G.,Interactive Manager,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Mar 12, 2010",4,4,nan,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: Rezware is an affordable system that was able to be customized to meet our unique needs. When doing our research, it was the only system that allowed for this customization while having a base to start from that understands our business type. The system we were looking for had to accomodate reservations for two types of daily tours running on an hourly basis. We were also able to incorporate our food and drink sales into the system which was a requirement. The reporting gives us various ways to look at our data which we found has been a real need. And, while the system took a while for everyone to get comfortable with, we now find that it is quite easy to use. There are lots of shortcuts and helpful tools within it as well. And, having the training mode that uses real data is another very useful tool. Finally, the people at Rezware have been very responsive to our questions and providing support whenever needed.","Cons: Due to the customization of our system, the implementation took longer than anticipated. And, we have run into some glitches that probably wouldn't have happened if we used the system as is. But, the technology and customer support team at Rezware went above and beyond to remedy any situations that occured. There is not enough written documentation on the system so we had to develop our own reference manual. Our training sessions and calls with Rezware have always been helpful and has allowed us to map out how to use the system for our needs.","Overall: Rezware is a solid system that we expect to be using for a long time. And, we look forward to growing into the system more by using the additional features that are available. The customization has been essential to the requirements of our business. And, the support on the system has been very responsive and understanding of our needs.",
rezware xp7,RezWare is a good basic Tour Package Management System,Wendi K.,CEO,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Apr 11, 2010",4,4,nan,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: The base package is easy to understand, allows for quite a bit of self-managed customization and the RezWare staff has been very helpful in training us how to get the most out of the system. The RezWeb Online module was easy to implement and the RezWeb programmers did a good job integrating with our web site graphics.",Cons: Our biggest challenge has been our own learning curve in understanding the impact of some of the custom programming changes we have requested of RezWare. We would have been better off to learn the system first and then decide what we wanted changed.,"Overall: My recommendation is that you first map your current requirements against the RezWare system. You need to understand what drives the data for your management reports and how the data flows through the system. Once you fully understand the core competency of Rezware, identify any potential custom modification requirements. Be sure and allocate enough time for testing before you need to go live with any changes.",
rezware xp7,Quite Flexible,Rachel G.,Office Manager,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Feb 23, 2010",4,5,nan,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: The system accurately displays reports, is quick to navigate and once you've been at it a while it really becomes second nature. The support staff is quick to respond to queries and explaining the ""brain"" behind the system so you know why things work as they do.",Cons: Some small system hangups with printing at times. Sometimes it takes a little longer than desired to get changes made but then again our system is pretty specialized considering its initial design.,"Overall: The system is good and it works. We have a very specialized version as we use it for racing reservations and keeping count of gift certificates, strange discounts, laps, guests and programs and they've been able to make it work well for us.",
