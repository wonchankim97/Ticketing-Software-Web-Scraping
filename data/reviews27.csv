accesso_showare,Easy to train volunteers and to pull reports. Gets the information I need.,Steve F.,Chief Executive Officer for Patron Services,,Used the software for: 2+ years,VR,Source: Capterra,17-Nov-17,5,5,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: Ease of use. Friendliness and helpfulness of support and sales teams. Much better reports from the old system we used prior to conversion. More flexibility for online offers. Much better response from our clients on the ease of use during online purchases. Better subscription processes. When I discover a ""bug"" in a procedure, the team is there to help resolve the issues. Flexibility of changing things on the fly. The support team is always willing to put in our suggestions we might have to improve the system when we might find things that others might be able to use as well.","Cons: With every system I have used in my 30 years in the ticketing industry there are always things that one would wish the new system to do. Some ideas coming from other systems, to others coming from volunteers, staff and administration asking if the system can do ""this"". After working on several different platforms, I know there is not a perfect system that can accommodate every need. Being a non-profit organization with limited funds it is sometimes too expensive to customize reports which results in having to run several reports to get all the information that I need and combine them into one for the administration, but I appreciate the reports are there that give me the information I need.",Overall: knowing that our sales are being recorded in a safe and secure method.,
accesso_showare,Best Ticket Software I Have Ever Used!,Amber P.,Ticketing & Box Office Manager,,Used the software for: 2+ years,VR,Source: Capterra,7-Oct-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: I have used many different ticketing softwares in my career, and Showare is by far the most user friendly...both for our end of things and for our patrons. After moving to Showare, we saw a 50% increase in internet sales, and our patrons actually commented what a great upgrade it was. I also like how quickly I can build shows and get them on sale to the public. Being on constant time restraints, it's nice to have so many quick capabilities. Perhaps the best thing about Showare is the client services team. Any question or issue is resolved incredibly fast. Sometimes we don't even know of an issue, and it's already remedied, and we are made aware ASAP. They take wonderful care of us and listen to all of our questions and ideas.","Cons: When we first decided on Showare, there were a few reports and capabilities that Showare did not perform, that we were used to having. Instead of turning us away, they listened to us and helped us create a new report for our needs. Additionally, there have been things that we thought would be great additions to the system, not only for us, but to other venues as well. A few upgrades later...there they were!","Overall: User-friendly, easy to navigate, up to date software, great upgrades, amazing customer service.",
accesso_showare,Great Software! Best Customer Service!,Daryl L.,Webmaster,"Recreational Facilities and Services, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,VR,Source: Capterra,17-Oct-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: We have more than pleased with the flexibility of ShoWare as well as its stellar customer service! When we initially planned to use the system, the training was beyond what I've experienced with any other vendor. Our employees were initially a little intimidated by such a powerful system but once they realized how easy it really is to use, they LOVE it! We have employees who look forward to selling tickets on ShoWare because it is so easy and so intuitive. We are not a huge venue...as an HOA we bring in individual shows as well as season packages. We see the value because we are able to market to residents as well as the surrounding community using ShoWare. We also love the fact that upgrades are regularly introduced with advance notice. We looked at a variety of ticketing options but ShoWare won hands down. Post go-live, their customer service continues to be a winner in our book! And, yes, I love ShoWare as a customer too!","Cons: We needed a system which could accommodate the various seat maps and configurations we use as well as sell season tickets to patrons. If what you need is general admission ticketing for one or two events, this software would be overkill.","Overall: Training, flexibility, excellent customer service and value, value, value!",
accesso_showare,Great software and unbeatable customer service!,Erica E.,Box Office Manager,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,28-Nov-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: We've been a Showare client for over 10 years and are still very happy with its ease of use (for both the customer and our team) and incredible flexibility.,"Cons: We're very excited that there is intergration with myemma, but hope that there will be more editing capabilities for scheduled messages soon.",Overall: We couldn't be happier with Showare as a ticketing solution and would absolutely recommend this software.,
accesso_showare,Ease of use paired with helpful and genuine customer service.,Amanda S.,Box Office Coordinator,"Government Administration, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,30-Nov-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Being new to the industry 4.5 years ago, accesso ShoWare is the only ticketing software I have used, and I couldn't imagine using anything else! Box Office associates and patrons alike find it very easy to navigate. After our venue decided to make some big changes to the seat numbering over the summer, our client services rep was very thorough and patient in helping me navigate through the process. What could have been a cumbersome project was made much easier due to his efforts.","Cons: A lot of patrons forget passwords/change email addresses, etc. and create new accounts instead updating their current account(s). I would love to be able to merge duplicate patrons accounts together.","Overall: We our very pleased with the software and appreciate the team at accesso ShoWare! Items such as setting up multiple dynamic pricing changes in advance and being able to hit ""enter"" after a keyword search (which might seem minor) are small pieces of continuous upgrades that are huge time savers and continue to grow our excitement for the product.",
accesso_showare,Switching to accesso Showare was the best decision we made!,Katie S.,Financial Director,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VR,Source: Capterra,12-Oct-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: accesso Showare is a great program which made our theater's ticketing process more efficient, effective, and allows us to spend our time focusing on great customer service. The fees are affordable, and the ease of use is unbeatable. We love the customer service they provide us too. Our patrons can pick their seats, make donations, and search our schedule with ease. Our staff can ring sales, take orders, and print tickets seamlessly. We would (and often do) recommend it to anyone.",,"Overall: We have seen more patrons, more effective marketing strategies, faster sales, and many more benefits from this software.",
accesso_showare,Excellent. Customer service is stellar,Stacy R.,Box Office Manager,,Used the software for: 2+ years,VR,Source: Capterra,15-Sep-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: The ability to have access to many back-end features. Ease of use once learned. The many features that have the ability to drive revenue.,"Cons: The data entry fields do not auto fill with proper punctuation on the web/back end. ie, capitalized first name, hyphens in phone #'s etc. Not all reports are downloadable. There is not one report that has comprehensive information ( info from patron order address report and ticket buyer report would be helpful)",,
accesso_showare,"In a world of complexity, Accesso ShoWare and their ease of use is a breath of fresh air.",Brian K.,Ticketing Manager,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,28-Nov-18,5,5,4,5,4,9,,Pros: The ease and control of building your own Events and Performances and simple point and click functionality allows for easy training of rotating staff throughout the year. The flexibility the system and the support team has for our unique style of selling tickets has been quite a blessing.,"Cons: As with most systems, the inability to change the delivery method on a completed order and not being able to do a partial refund seamlessly can be a bit of a burden. Thankfully these scenarios don't come into play too often and we can work around them.",Overall: ShoWare is a great product for any venue looking for an easy system to use that allows the ability for the Box Office management to create and control their events. This take the stress off of relying on another entity to create your manifests and hope they finish on time.,
accesso_showare,Showare has changed the way we sell tickets for the better. It is truly a worry free process.,Tracy G.,"Director, Account Services","Internet, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VR,Source: Capterra,8-Nov-17,5,4,5,5,5,10,,Pros: The process is streamlined and there are no surprises. It's easy to track current sales and report on them later. The recent updates to the software have made huge strides towards ease of use and flexibility. We have very active patrons and the servers never get overloaded so everyone leaves happy and with tickets. Our account manager is extremely communicative. He checks in on us and monitors every sale. We couldn't do it without him!,Cons: Set up is tedious if working with a tour of multiple venues. It's not hard but it does take time to set up each individual seat map. I would love if we could update seat maps after they're applied to a performance. Otherwise well done!,Overall: Our ticket selling process has streamlined and is now a no stress experience. We never worry about our sales running without a hitch. That peace of mind is invaluable to us as manage ticket access to the fans of some of the biggest musicians in the industry.,
accesso_showare,Love working with ShoWare products especially the new updates.,Angela M.,Box Office Manager,,Used the software for: 2+ years,VR,Source: Capterra,19-Sep-17,4,5,5,5,4,8,,"Pros: The best pro about this software is the user friendly, easy to navigate and most important, I really like the user friendly help tab. The help tab gears you in the right direction when you need that quick refreshing of how to do or understand something your forgot.","Cons: One thing I can say I would like to see an update on is when patrons enter a code, and the prices automatically change instead of using a drop box which to many can become very confusing, especially to elderly or non computer users.",,
accesso_showare,Showare is a great value for the money,Steve F.,Chief Executive Officer for Patron Services,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,28-Nov-18,5,5,4,5,5,10,,Pros: The ease of training new people on the system. Our patrons love the online purchase procedure. The ease of setting up a season and individual shows for sale. The reports cover almost everything you can imagine and you can also have them customize reports (at a cost of course) but it is well worth the value.,"Cons: I mentioned the reports are great, but there is always room for improvement and could always add more reports as you never know what you are going to need next.",Overall: Selling ticket on line and up selling to the patrons as they are buying one show and might be interested in other upcoming shows. Our accountant is much happier with the reports and the ease of use pulling information from the system to balance the daily books.,
accesso_showare,Great software so far,John B.,Managing Director,,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,12-Jun-18,4,4,4,3,5,10,,Pros: The software is easy to use for the patron which is most important. I'm a quick learner so it was easy to learn to system and for me to train volunteers and other members of our team. They've had two updates so far since I've been using it. Updates are always fantastic. I love the advertising possibilities both onsite and confirmation email.,"Cons: We sell tickets for different events (promoters), and not necessarily a venue. These promoters have volunteers, which we call committee members, sell tickets on their behalf directly from their mobile phone (cash transactions), if this system had that feature, I will blow my competition out of the water, along with the other features, as the touchscreen only works well for tablets.Some of the reports are only view only and cannot be downloaded.",,
accesso_showare,We love accesso ShoWare's product and service.,Nancy K.,MWF Ticket Office Manager,,Used the software for: 2+ years,VR,Source: Capterra,19-Oct-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: It is versatile in meeting all our needs. On the few occasions minor issues have come up, the customer service has been attentive and prompt. All issues are quickly addressed and resolved.",,Overall: We are much more efficient in meeting the needs of our patrons and the Brigade of Midshipmen.,
accesso_showare,Longtime relationship with ShoWare,Lauren M.,Owner,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,6-Dec-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: We were the very first customer of ShoWare so we have seen the product/software grow since 2004. The ease of use has reached a wonderful level. It is so easy to train new employees on the system. As upgrades are added they have usually been easy to understand and easy to integrate into our daily use.,Cons: Most cons are really only small issues here and there. They have mostly been resolved over time. No major cons at this point!,,
accesso_showare,ShowWare has been very gracious in training me and assisting whenever needed.,Pamela F.,Box Office Supervisor,"Entertainment, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,VR,Source: Capterra,25-Oct-17,4,5,4,5,4,7,,Pros: I like that it is easy to navigate for myself and the cashiers within the Box Office. The newer features where I can adjust a seat map for a specific show without it affecting the seat maps of other shows using the same seat map is helpful.,Cons: I wish there was a full map seat selection view both within the box office and for the customers to navigate more easily.,Overall: It is easy to quickly train staff and provide notes within the Box Office tab to guide them with notes for each show.,
accesso_showare,Long Time Customer,Tracy G.,"Director, Digital Services","Online Media, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,29-Nov-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: First and foremost our account manager has been incredibly responsive and helpful. So many companies don't have any sort of customer service or if they do they don't have someone who will pick up the phone.I know I can call Customer support if I have a question and he's always there to help me out. I've been using ShoWare for many years and it only gets better with every improvement and feature add.","Cons: It does take a good bit of training to get comfortable on the system, but that's to be expected as ticketing is a complicated process. It's a little more complicated for a touring artist than it would be for a venue with the same few seating charts but we've been able to make it work for our purposes without any big issues.",,
accesso_showare,Great ticketing system!,Lydia R.,Box Office Manager,"Music, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,21-Nov-18,5,5,5,5,5,9,,"Pros: The customization, reporting and messaging capabilities make it possible to create beautiful and detailed event pages with ease.","Cons: Would love to see a live, interactive seat map integrated soon!","Overall: Our customer service rep was an absolute pleasure to work with! He was extremely helpful and attentive, with quick responses to any questions that may arise.",
accesso_showare,ShoWare is GREAT!,Jay L.,General Manager,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,29-Nov-18,5,4,4,5,4,10,,Pros: Easy to use. Very intuitive. Handles all aspects for our non-profit PAC.,"Cons: Sometimes can be a bit buggy, but the customer support is quick and helpful!","Overall: organized ticketing, membership, donations and sponsorship values in ONE PLACE.

accesso_showare,"Easy to use, ShoWare is a good choice for ticketing",Verified Reviewer,General Manager,"Philanthropy, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,1-Aug-18,4,4,4,4,4,8,,Pros: ShoWare is a reliable tool to track ticket sales and manage our box office. It seems to be improving and we've received compliments on it from our patrons.,"Cons: ShoWare generates reports on ticket sales etc, but that isn't integrated into our other databases. We struggle managing that data, but that isn't exactly a limitation of the software.",Overall: ShoWare allows us to advertise and sell tickets to many many events throughout the year.,
accesso_showare,"accesso ShoWare, Two Years In",Kieran A.,Guest Services Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,16-Mar-15,4,3,4,5,4,8,"Comments: We've just finished year two of accesso ShoWare after transitioning from a completely offline ticketing system. accesso ShoWare revolutionized the way we collect information about our guests. It feels like we've only scratched the surface of the amount of detail we can utilize.We are a general admission daily attraction, and so unlike most of accesso ShoWare's usual clientele. In that regard, they have been great at working with us and helping us adapt the system to our needs. They are quick to offer solutions and check up to see how things are going. Any functionality problems we've had have been quickly solved.With that in mind, the ease of use of accesso ShoWare for us as a general admission attraction suffers a bit- the amount of bending and adapting we've had to do to make accesso ShoWare work for our needs has created a steep learning curve for Box Office staff as some of the functionality is not necessarily intuitive for what we do. As with any system that's not custom made, there are functions we would wish for but that's to be expected.We're looking forward to the next year of accesso ShoWare.",,,,
accesso_showare,"The ""almost"" perfect fit for your ticketing needs.",John V.,Director Of Ticket Services,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,20-Mar-15,4,4,4,5,4,8,"Comments: I say almost mainly because as all grown ups know, nothing is actually perfect. However accesso ShoWare does come close in many ways. It's overall a user friendly product, easily teachable to use to ever changing staff if your a University. Like all web based ticketing systems the adjustments that you may need to make if an error is made in certain modules can be a bit frustrating. This is where accesso Showare's 5 Star Customer Service shines through. Not only is the account management team knowledgeable , efficient, and friendly. The company as a whole is firmly dedicated to improving the product based on the actual needs of their clientele. I find that very refreshing. Although not all input is able to be incorporated. accesso Showare's production team will keep it in mind for future releases and you may be very pleasantly surprised to see your venue idea added to a broader upgrade feature. Overall a great value and a worthy investment for venues of any size.",,,,
accesso_showare,accesso ShoWare Ticketing System,Tracie L.,Audience Development Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,12-Mar-15,4,4,4,4,4,8,"Comments: Overall, accesso ShoWare has proven to be very user-friendly for our customers. I think there is a lot of potential with marketing upcoming shows via the online ticketing and Facebook that we haven't tapped yet. On the back end, I am disappointed with the gift certificate system--or lack of--so I'd love for that to be improved. I also wish there was a way to regulate how many tickets are printed with each order (a header and a receipt aren't always necessary) to prevent wasting excess ticket stock. Also, could a way to search a customer by address be added? That would be quite helpful.",,,,
accesso_showare,Customer Service!,Shawna T.,Box Office & Events Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,12-Mar-15,4,4,4,5,4,8,"Comments: We picked up accesso ShoWare to replace our previous, somewhat obsolete, software. We knew in taking the product that it was still a bit young and had room to grow. The fact that it is a growing product is what gives it both pros and cons. There are a lot of nice features already, but there is still room for improvement in terms of reporting, ease of checkout, and fund development. The company welcomes input from its customer base and uses that input to fuel its upgrades. The response from staff to resolve problems is quite good. We look forward to sticking with the company to see where it goes as it seems to always be looking for areas in which to improve.",,,,

accesso_showare,accesso ShoWare Appreciation!,Carissa C.,Box Office Coordinator,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,16-Mar-15,4,3,4,5,4,8,"Comments: accesso ShoWare ticketing has allowed flexibility in the way we operate our box office. Everything from year-round events, gate admission bundled with Grandstand shows, and specialty events within our Spring and State Fairs. There have been a few hiccups jumping from an older version to the current versions based on our customized needs but we are always able to work on better possible solutions to fit our business. I want to give a shout out to my project manager, Heather, for always taking the time to address our concerns, testing possible solutions and being a pleasure to work with!",,,,

A robust back-end user interface that's also user friendly makes accesso ShoWare easy to get up and running in very little time. Furthermore, their customer service and support has always been top notch, especially for new users to the system. Even their 24hr support line has been extremely helpful in getting me the answers I need when I need them...NOW!

The concert tickets are also sold on the system but customers get confused by the basket. We demand more than other clients on accesso ShoWare for various purposes, i.e. the concerts include gate admission or we pair with discount retailers, so often times we have to come up with our own work around. However, the accounting in accesso ShoWaree for the most part is accurate. The accesso ShoWare team is helpful too.",,,,
