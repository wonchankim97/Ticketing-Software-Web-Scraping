There are so many other features about Event Master that are so useful; vendor and volunteer management, marketing and promotion codes, other reports.",Cons: There are so many features - I wish I had more time to learn them.

spingo,Very Clunky User Experience,Verified Reviewer,nan,Hospital & Health Care,Source: Capterra,NO,nan,"Jan 23, 2018",2,1,1,5,nan,nan,,Pros: I like the ability to list events on multiple event calendars. The customer support has also been good. They've been very responsive. I spoke to someone on the phone and he made very helpful recommendations about which promotions to choose for our events.,"Cons: I'm using the free version, so the experience may be different if you use the Event Master version. First, let's look at listing events. You can upload one picture and Spingo crops it two different ways. There is a tool that is supposed to let you show Spingo which part of the picture to focus on, but it does not work at all. Pictures are often cropped strangely or there is spaced left above and below the picture. I'd really like to be able to upload multiple versions of our creative. Also, every time I list an event I have to reenter my information. You aren't able to store it in your profile. Any time you need to edit an event, you have to submit a request. It takes a day or two for the revisions to be made, and sometimes they aren't exactly what you asked for, so you have to ask again. Sometimes the site gets pretty buggy, too. I click edit event and I get taken to the promotion page. I click view event and I get taken to the promotion page. I see old versions of events that were supposed to have been edited or events that I deleted in my account.","Overall: Saves an incredible amount of time, opens up a whole world of reporting capabilities, comparisons to previous years, manage vendors, volunteers, allows to monitor sales and gives better control of our event data and statistics.",
spingo,"Great customer support, unfortunately platform didn't suit us too well for our event.",Nicole R.,Production Manager,,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Jul 05, 2018",2,2,2,4,nan,nan,,Pros: Reporting was useful for gathering information for our workers/interns,"Cons: Isn't too well suited to our events. MUST have email traffic within system. Needs to be more customizable to suit different types of events, have the gamer profile was very confusing for our workers/interns signing up. This doesn't pertain to us so it shouldn't even be showing . We have workers & interns, so we had to break those up.","Overall: Saves an incredible amount of time, opens up a whole world of reporting capabilities, comparisons to previous years, manage vendors, volunteers, allows to monitor sales and gives better control of our event data and statistics.",
