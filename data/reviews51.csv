explara ticketing software,The Explara Ticketing Platform,Ayushi M.,Marketing & Partnerships,"Events Services, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 20, 2019",5,4,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: We started using Explara as a ticketing platform for our events in May 2018.

We integrated it in our website and since then have been using it daily.

As we are an events company, we needed a software that could easily help us manage our event ticketing and explara has been a good choice.

When we started events in Singapore last year, we were not sure how to go about with the ticketing.

But with the Explara team's support and guidance, we were able to manage that smoothly.","Cons: There are many good things about this software. But certain things need a little improvement.

1. The payout invoices we receive need to be more detailed. Since we are only 2 people managing all the events, it gets difficult to visit the dashboard each time to check the payout for each event.

If along with payout structure that we receive, we would get information about what event tickets we have received a payout for, it will be very helpful.

2. The formatting of the event description can be made better.",,
