online box office system,168tickets is the choice,Alexander S.,Artistic and Managing Director,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Apr 12, 2010",4,5,nan,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: + inexpensive system

+ simple with lots of features

+ perfectly flexible and adjustable for the different needs

+ very helpful and qualified staff

+ nice people to work with

+ amazingly quick responses on our requests

+ very personal work relationship",Cons: We have not experienced any yet.,"Overall: We had been investigating new ticketing systems for quite a while, and 168tickets was one of the companies we took a closer look at.

The reasons we chose their product were because their offer was kept simple, easy to understand and very inexpensive.

What they offer is great and fits our needs perfectly: from single tickets to full season passes with different pricing per event, ticket printing at home and other features which will help our office staff tremendously. What absolutely convinced me was their incredibly short response time to our requests during the set-up period, and how helpful they were in assisting us to get everything up and running. I don't think any other company could have done any better, so I highly recommend 168tickets from our experience so far. Also, every time you call or email, you deal with the same person which means you don't have to explain your problem over and over again.",

online box office system,168 Tickets makes selling tickets a breeze!!,Charisse N.,Office Manager & Fair Secretary,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Sep 19, 2014",5,5,nan,5,nan,nan,"Comments: 168 Tickets makes selling tickets for our grandstand events during the Lorain County Fair so easy! The program is very user friendly and it gives us accurate accounting reports for our reports and audits. Joe is very responsive to questions - usually answering via email within minutes. This year, we did the print at home/text option and our customers loved it! If there was a con, it's that the tickets all look similar and our grandstand ushers would like each show printed on different ticket stock so they didn't have to look at them closely - but the print at home/scan option takes care of some of that issue. But I can't say enough good things about this program - it's affordable, simple to use, and we get great customer service!",Pros: The 168 staff is always available to help and the software is very easy to use.
