ticketleap,"Easy, User friendly & Beautiful Event Management System",Caitlin K.,Marketing Manager,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Sep 05, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: I love the easy, visual, drag and drop event page editor. It has simple yet elegant design features (choose your event page color of choice, upload an image, draft your event description and tagline, input your event hashtag to pull in your instagram & twitter feed, etc.). I also love that it is super easy to create coupon codes for specific events, export spreadsheets of attendees, and include customized event questions (anything you want with multiple question field options). I've also experienced great customer service- very relational and helpful phone calls with little to no wait time.","Cons: Ticketleap is made for events that are on one date (not a span of multiple dates) so you have to get a little creative when it comes to dates for longer events (like conferences, etc).",,
ticketleap,I like it a lot.,Glen J.,General Manager,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jul 06, 2019",4,4,4,4,4,8.0,,"Pros: TicketLeap has a shopping cart *and* recurring event support. If a patron wants to buy tickets for multiple performances of the same show, across multiple dates or times, TicketLeap lets you select everything you want and enter your payment information just once. It's not the cheapest, but it does what I need. Every year I take another look around at what's available, in case I've missed something prettier or cooler or cheaper, but I end up staying with TicketLeap. It's also easy to refund tickets for people that made mistakes. I think I've swapped performances for people too. And -- I've done discounted advance cash sales and sent the buyers tickets via the management back end, and was not charged a fee.",Cons: I don't recall having any particular complaints.,Overall: It's been really positive.,
