ThunderTix is fabulous!,Megan F.,Office Manager,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Apr 19, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: There are a lot of pros to it. It is very user friendly and easy to understand and put events together. Kinda repeating what I put on the first page: ""when we first started, we had a lot of questions figuring it all out, but reaching customer support was super simple. When I contacted I got a response within 24 hours. The customer representative is usually the main person I deal with and she is amazing. She always is super friendly and very knowledgable for every problem we have. She always knows exactly where to direct me and how to answer it, so I would highly recommend to anyone.""","Cons: Anything I would suggest would probably be:

I wish there was an easier way to do ""at the door stuff."" I don't think I have researched it enough to know enough about it, but we would love to figure out a better way to run that more.","Overall: ThunderTix is fabulous! It is very easy to use and to put an event together. When we first started, we had a lot of questions figuring it all out, but reaching customer support was super simple. When I contacted I got a response within 24 hours. The customer representative is usually the main person I deal with and she is amazing. She always is super friendly and very knowledgeable about every problem we have. She always knows exactly where to direct me and how to answer it, so I would highly recommend to anyone.","Recommendations to other buyers: One other thing I had a question about is that sometimes there are some parents that say they don't receive their tickets by email. I am not sure if there is a reason behind that or if it is just by chance it got lost or went to spam. I am not sure, but just wanted to throw that in there too."
The Best Online Ticketing Model,Todd H.,President,,,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Mar 10, 2011",4,4,5,4,5,10.0,,"Pros: #1 - No added/rising fees to our patrons!

Improving interface

Customized

Compatible with Authorize.net

Reasonable cost

PDF Ticketing

Easy to train

Reliable and Available","Cons: Reporting still being developed/enhanced

Better testing and version control has been requested

No real-CRM capability for patron management/history

Development seems focused on ""new"" features (i.e. Facebook integration) more than refinement of existing features (i.e. reporting)

Error codes are confusing to patrons when transactions are not going through

Transaction/Administration speeds varies (system tweaking is needed after most iterations)",Overall: When we selected ThunderTix they were the only online ticket service that we could find that did not charge a 'per ticket service fee' to our customers. That model was vital to our selection as we do not believe online ticketing should be cost a premium over walk-ups.,
ThunderTix Gets It Right The First Time,Randolph S.,Public Relations Chair,,,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Dec 29, 2011",4,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: To begin with, this was the first time our organization has attempted to sell tickets online. Our experience with ThunderTix was almost exclusively positive.","Cons: While there isn't much I can say in the way of cons, I will list the one minor annoyance we had (has been resolved though) when using the system.",Overall: ThunderTix is the absolutely the best online ticketing system I have found to date. There were a number of companies which pitched their products and we tried a number of them. Ultimately none of the competing products were as simple to use or as well suited to our needs.,
Excellent platform for online booking; Top-notch and responsive customer service,John H.,Owner,"Recreational Facilities and Services, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Apr 06, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Ease of use. Easy to get new employees trained. Powerful reports for marketing and order tracking. Allows you to put all your inventory online and have just one platform for box office walk-up, phone and online bookings. Seamless. The online question and answer section is excellent.",Cons: Can't really think of anything.,"Overall: We've been using Thundertix since 2011 for my busy sailing tour and charter business. Before we chose Thundertix, we thoroughly evaluated at least five other online reservation/booking software systems and found that Thundertix's combination of features, simple user interface , powerful back end for reports and pricing could not be beat. We are often approached by other competitors and have sometimes looked at other systems to see if we're missing anything and Thundertix combination of features and pricing (no ticket fees) wins hands down every time. The fact that you have total control over any fees (or not) charged to your customers is very appealing. When on occasion, we've had a suggestion for an improvement, we've often seen it implemented. If you have an issue you can get someone to respond quickly. They're all excellent. Thundertix is really top-notch.","Recommendations to other buyers: I suggest you try it out. They can give you a demo, or set you can sign up for a short period."
ThundertTix Rocks,Leona R.,Coordinator,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jun 27, 2019",5,4,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: The customer service is superb. We love the ability to have multi level tickets, ticket discounts & the ability to customize tickets in detail. Love the reserving ability for seats and that it is controlled by us and not the public. Appreciate that you allow us to add in cash or check sales to keep track of all sales for an event. It has made our ability to account for an event at the end 100% better.","Cons: The inability to have a store for merchandise separate from adding to a ticket.

Refunds & exchanges to multi day events can get very confusing. Most for us in theater as people will purchase tickets & exchange for another show time. The money flow can be confusing when doing the books for close out.","Overall: Thundertix has boosted our ticket sales for all events. It promotes advance registration and reduces cancellations, changes and refunds. However, having those options available in the system has made it easier for us to maneuver changes when they must be made. Our customer love the ability to do things on line from home, yet have the ability call or stop in & we can make the reservations for them.",
eTicketing made easy,Rian I.,Founder,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Nov 03, 2015",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,"Comments: I have a small business where I have to sell tickets online to reach my out of town customers. And being small, I need every dollar I can get to keep my tours going. I have been using other 3rd party ticketing sites, and I loose a lot of my profit to pay these big sites their 3+ percent fee for every ticket I sell. My tickets sell for $150+, loosing 3-4% of every tickets adds up quick and I got sick of it, searching for alternative. Then I found ThunderTix!! Hands down, ThunderTix beats all of those ticketing sites. I pay a annual flat rate fee, therefor I know exactly what my cost will be for ticketing. And when you break down the ThunderTix cost per ticket, we're talking pocket change per ticket! That means, I'm actually making money off of my tickets again!",,,,
Clay Eichler Memorial Fund appreciates Thundertix and Pam!Ei,Gail E.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 23, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: We started a non profit in 2014. I have volunteered in a lot of areas over my years, but I've never been one of the main people behind starting a non profit much less throwing a concert and golf scramble in the same day. With a lot of amazing help from friends our events were successful. I credit thundertix with the ease of getting information to supporters. This kept our contributors in the know, they knew when to expect their tickets to be emailed. We started solitciting money 6 months before our event. We did not want to mail tickets to them 4 months before they needed them...



Please know when I say we had no experience, I mean we had none. Two of my friends who are either present/past treasurers of org. are also my treasurers. They input all the sponsorships, donations, ticket purchases, golf registrations, tshirt sales, etc. into thundertix. We were very hesitant at first, but with multiple calls to Pam initially and very frequently later, we are smooth sailing.She only showed concern and kindness when we called. This is so needed in our world today. I would recommend this to anyone who is selling tickets to an event.

The availability to contact your donors is at your fingertips. We decided to email tickets to customers 2 weeks before our event. We send an email right away, to let them know we have received their sponsorship, thank them for it and let them know when to expect their tickets. It makes it so easy for everyone. The supporters and in our case, our volunteers.

I spent many hours looking at different options and I know we made the right choice.

The customer service from Pam is more than it's weight in gold. I am not kidding, she could help with every issue. This is only our 3rd year to use the software, in this time period, there have been several ""upgrades"".

One other thing that made it really nice for us, especially as beginners, is the compatibility between thundertix and our credit card payment system. They worked it out behind the scenes where any credit card information is not on my website. When a customer hits the sponsorship or donate tab, they are immediately taken to another website where this information is taken on a much more encrypted safe site than mine.

In 2 years we have given back $265,000.00 to our community. There has been a lot of information submitted in Thundertix.",,,,
Fee free ticketing system,Glen M.,President,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Apr 19, 2017",5,4,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Has a lot of flexibility for other season ticket passes, private functions, and for displaying ticketing information on our website",Cons: Would like more integration options with Canadian merchant gateways,"Overall: We selected Thundertix because they did not charge us on the basis of a per ticket fee. Our customers hated paying add on fees, and Thundertix was the only company that we found that did not charge that way.",
I really enjoy working with Thundertix. It is a very user-friendly program.,Nina S.,Audience Relations Manager,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 19, 2018",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: The ease of use of creating events and how easy it is to apply the program to our website. I also enjoy the incredibly fast response from their customer service. There is also a Request a Feature page and you can ad your request or problem to it and vote for others that have already been submitted. The Thundertix team works on the requests in order of votes or sometimes fixes a glitch right away. The newest feature I got really excited about is the shopping cart, which gives patrons the option to purchase several events in one transaction.",Cons: That I can't get into an attempted order by a customer who made a mistake (in real time). I have to wait until the remaining checkout time has passed instead of being able to cancel the transaction for them and to start over.,,
Best Bang for your Buck!,Katie H.,Social Media Manager,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Aug 13, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: We love the price partnered with all the incredible features. Also, Thundertix is ALWAYS working to improve and is ALWAYS adding new and exciting features based on their customers requests. Their customer service is also amazing!",Cons: I wish that there was more of a variety of email softwares that ThunderTix software could automatically import to.,Overall: We are able to offer fair ticket mark-up costs to our customers compared to other ticketing platforms which charge way to much for their services.,
Best decision ever!,Chesley M.,"Board Member, Ticket Chairman","Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Oct 24, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: This program has been easy to use since day one. Now we are beginning year four, and they introduce new features every year! It is easy to set up events and manage the behind the scenes of the software, and even easier to use it to sell tickets on location at our events, and it's the easiest to purchase them as a customer! Its a win for everyone! Reports are easy to run and are complete and customizable as to what information is included on them. And one of my favorite newer features is a daily email with total sales.","Cons: I really like it all! Possibly entering coupon codes had a bit of a learning curve to it, but I have it down now and it works like a charm.","Overall: ThunderTix has been the best decision we could have made! It is all easy to use, and the Support Team is quick to respond and meet your needs. They also are always taking suggestions from their customers about new features to introduce! (They even credit the customer when they do!) And the pricing is perfect for those of us who do not sell tickets year-round. You move to maintenance months/pricing until you are ready to sell again. I have been the sole contact person for our company since day one, and have never had a anything but positive experiences with ThunderTix!",
ThunderTix continually provides outstanding service!,Alecia O.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Sep 08, 2016",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: I was lucky enough to have found ThunderTix when I worked for The Cider Mill Playhouse in Endicott, New York, almost ten years ago. Stacy Chapman helped me learn the system and how to easily customize it for our oddly shaped (half circle thrust) theater. Our older, not-so-computer-savvy customers found it to be extremely user friendly and it really streamlined the box office experience too! Two years ago I became the Marketing Director for the Chenango Arts Council in Norwich, New York, whose ticketing system was really in need of updating. I suggested we look into ThunderTix, recalling the positive experience I had in the past. Stacy Chapman was still with the company and had gotten a well deserved promotion, but she remembered me from the Cider Mill! And I remembered her of course, because she was so helpful and proactive. The ThunderTix system proved to be exactly what we needed. Stacy once again held my hand through the set-up process, even though it wasn't really her job anymore. Pam Mason has also been extremely helpful, and our audience feedback reveals their experience just gets more and more enjoyable. What prompts me to write this is the almost uncanny ability ThunderTix has in predicting what I'm going to need next. The old seat blocking function allowed me to block our season subscribers' favorite seats so we could go online to the general public for ticket sales earlier than usual, which was great! But I faced the laborious old unblocking system which I knew would be time consuming. Lo and behold on September 1st, I can unblock seats with just a click!!! So happy! How did ThunderTix know? Just another example of listening to their clients and being proactively thinking ahead! I will always highly recommend ThunderTix to anyone looking for a straightforward, user-friendly, customer friendly, intuitive ticketing system, and I truly appreciate all the time and effort Stacy, Pam, and all the staff and programmers obviously put into their jobs. Well done, and THANK YOU!",,,,
"Approachable company that listens to its clients, and has implemented great new features.",Glynnis D B.,Volunteer,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 19, 2018",5,4,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: AFFORDABLE!!!!! Easy to implement, easy to train, easy to use, easy to maintain, easy to understand subscription models. Flexible as to gateway providers. We are a small not-for-profit community theatre group, entirely volunteer run. Our margins are very tight. We are grateful for your ticketing software that allows us to spread our reach to the internet. We now often sell out shows BEFORE the open.","Cons: There is often too much info on the FAQ & Community sites. I dont have the time to wade through it all looking for my quick question. Really LOVE your responsive support folks who will take the time to answer my questions, even if the answer is already out there.",,
Great product for our ticketing needs!,Wendy K.,Event Support manager,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Nov 16, 2018",5,4,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: We really like that is is user friendly for the customer, our reps and our users. The support is beyond excellent anytime a question or concern pops up. We get prompt and helpful answers.","Cons: The issue we run into sometimes is when there is an update, there can be an unforeseen effect on other areas of the software that will need a fix.","Overall: Thundertix has provided us with the tools we need to make purchasing tickets to our events all over the country as user friendly as possible. The added benefits like automated email reminders, product sales, waitlists and email marketing options have all had a positive impact on our customers and our sales.",
"This our 6th year with THUNDERTIX, they have THE best ticketing software service around",Craig Y.,President,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Aug 26, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: The interface is very customer friendly, is graphical, and easy to set up. Customer Service is quick, personable and very helpful. THUNDERTIX doesn't stand on its laurels, and each year a new addition, refinement, and addition to make our lives easier. As a 501C3 Organization with one event that funds our entire year's budget, we simply cannot have a problem. THUNDERTIX COMES THROUGH FOR US, YEAR AFTER YEAR.","Cons: Initial set up fee to integrate our theater venue into the software was a bit expensive, but amortized over a period of years, it's been a worthwhile investment.","Overall: It's friendly user interface for both vendor and customer, makes buying tickets easy to administer, even for casual internet users. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",
"Awesome software, exceptional customer service, great price - The complete Package!",Brian B.,Box Office Manager,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 03, 2011",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Since joining our organization several years ago, my first priority was to implement an automated ticketing system. I tested several vendors. We wanted to control what our patrons paid (if anything) to purchase tickets. So many vendor's pass on these high costs to the patrons to pay for the service. But Thundertix allows us to set the costs we might choose to pass on to our patrons. Not to mention that the cost of implementation was very reasonable and almost painless. They worked with us to customize and integrate their site to maintain the same look and feel of ours. Most of our patrons have no idea they're even on a third party site when buying tickets. Now they're taking things to the next level and integrating even more tools into their system that people use every day (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, YouTube and MySpace). They're always working to enhance their system. Their response to issues is like lightening. So the thunderbolt logo is very appropriate.",Cons: I honestly cannot think of any cons. And that is something you don't hear every day.,"Overall: I along with the rest of our board would highly recommend Thundertix to any organization looking for a simple, easy to use ticketing site that allows you to take control and save your patrons money and save yourself time. They are always improving their site and introduce new features, many of which come at no addtional cost, for their customers. They are extremely responsive to any questions, concerns or any unlikely problems you might encounter. They really are the best.",
ThunderTix is amazing,Shelby S.,Operations Manager,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Sep 15, 2016",5,4,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: The reporting features are a must have for us, especially for the ticket-holder list the day-of an event. We also utilize the plugins like Constant Contact which helps reduce time spent entering emails of attendees on the back-end before sending out a mass email. The ease of editing an event is also appreciated.",Cons: It takes quite awhile to populate/generate a report when you want to export sometimes.,"Overall: Southern Arizona Arts & Cultural Alliance switched to ThunderTix for all ticket sales several years ago and its improved our ability to manage all facets of ticking for our events. As a non-profit, the bottom-line is also always a consideration and we find that ThunderTix is the most affordable ticketing service that gives the most bang-for-your-buck on the market.",
Support is primarily available through email or forums. It's difficult to speak to a person.,Kathy R.,Administrative Assistant,"Religious Institutions, 51-200 employees",,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 23, 2018",4,3,3,3,4,6.0,,Pros: It integrates nicely with credit card payments and was easy to set up on that front. It was VERY easy to scan tickets with the app as well.,"Cons: It's not as intuitive. Finding out where to click to sell tickets, to design tickets, how to make them look the way we needed them to look...it actually required note-taking that I could refer to because things weren't in the obvious places to look. But once that was learned, it became easy to make the software do what we needed. I feel like part of it might actually be the web design as opposed to the software...for example, there are two rows of tabs. The top row is supposed to be related to your account, and the second row to your specific event. It doesn't SAY that anywhere, and I think there are exceptions, but we had to figure it out. (Notice that I'm still not sure about that, and I've been the one primarily working on the event.) I feel like someone on the phone would have figured that out right away and told us and saved us a couple of hours of clicking, but finding a phone number is next to impossible. Email is responsive, though, so it's not like they leave you completely in the dark. It's just not convenient.","Overall: I'm not sure that we did. I do know that I'd want to try it again now that we understand it more and see if we can make it fit our needs in other areas. After that, I'll decide if I'd be willing to recommend it.",
Small Company with a Great Product,Jon E.,"Member, Board of Directors","Entertainment, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 08, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: ThunderTix is a smaller ticketing company with a great product team! Being a smaller company, feature requests for new functionality are honored frequently and quickly. In addition to their standard support features, a Facebook group offers insights and a chance to chat with other users to see how they do things and what is working well in their organizations.","Cons: There isn't anything that comes to mind as a true ""Con"" to the software. There are some features we don't want our customers using, and we have found it easy to hide those features by using CSS.",,
Thundertix is the way to go when using choosing a ticketing system!,Carrie L.,Office Manager,"Entertainment, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 31, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: I like how I can manage our shows so easily. Thundertix is continually adding new features that give us new capabilities in reporting, the way we view our shows and the way we manage our shows as a whole.",Cons: There isn't anything I would change at this point.,"Overall: We have been using Thundertix for our ticketing system for years now and I could not be more pleased with their service, prices and willingness to help us in any area that is needed. I work in the Corporate Office in Gruene and we use Thundertix for our ticketing system for Gruene Hall. As you can imagine Thundertix plays a vital role in our day to day tickets sales and we rest assured knowing they are always making sure everything is up and running and that if there is a problem that they are working to fix it as quick as possible. I 100% recommend Thundertix to all businesses in this line of work. You will not be disappointed!",
Works Wonderful!! We love using this site for our ticket sales! It is so easy to use and nice layout,Grant S.,OWNER,"Music, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 19, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: The ease of use is amazing. It makes it so anyone can us the site, even if you do not know computers! Seeing ticket sales and recording and keeping track of them is not a hassle with your site!",Cons: The one thing I like least about the software is that it limits search results for sales to 365 days only.,Overall: Ease of knowing my event is listed and available to everyone and so easy to use by us and our customers!,
Universal and all-in-one-place,Verified Reviewer,OWNER,201-500 employees,Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 28, 2018",4,5,5,4,3,9.0,,Pros: My girlfriend and I go out frequently as we are located in an urban city and so using ThunderTix makes dealing with the whole ticket-ordeal so much easier than it needs to be. Everything is centrally located making it fast and easy.,Cons: Some of the features are a bit useless (TO US) and so it'd be nice to have a dynamic pricing plan; we don't use the gift card selling feature nor the event/reports feature.,,
Best value around!,Jim T.,Marketing and web designer,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Sep 12, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Thundertix is easy to use, with great support only a phone call away if you need it. The software is continually improved based on the needs of clients.",Cons: Nothing to dislike! We have had zero complaints from our customers.,"Overall: Thundertix has been very positive for our venue, our customers love the convenience and ease of use.

I recommend them constantly to others in our industry.",
"Great experience, very simple interface",Jeffrey H.,Reservation Manager,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 19, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Simple to use! Updates are based on user input, and happen frequently. Customer service is personal, and responsive. Cost is great!","Cons: Very little not to like about Thundertix. Years ago there were several limitations, but as of now (April 2018) there is nothing we have on our wish list.",Overall: Easy to manager dinner theater software!,
Great product for large and small businesses,Verified Reviewer,Reservation Manager,"Fine Art, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 26, 2019",5,5,5,5,4,10.0,,"Pros: Thundertix Is very customizable. My organization uses it for collecting payments for event tickets, intensives/workshops, and classes in our semesters. You can get the breakdown of each event easily and quickly which saves you times and shows you where to continue investing your time and products in. The interface is easy for clients to navigate and simple for staff members to learn how to utilize.","Cons: Functionality wise there are minor bumps in the road, but the support team is great with taking feedback, finding you an immediate solution, and taking your criticism into consideration for future updates.",Overall: Overall I've had a wonderful experience with Thundertix. If I were running my own business this would be the first program I'd have in mind to utilize. The support/service team is excellent and I hope to maintain a good relationship with them.,
"Overall, the ticket purchase process is user-friendly. Setting up an event was easy to figure out.",Leslie D.,Registrar,,Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 26, 2018",5,4,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: What we liked most about the software was to be able to modify some of the features such as the fee, comp codes, reserved seating and block seating. It is easy to set up as event and make corrections.","Cons: There are three things that we would suggest:

Ticket Sales Exchange - If the customer requests to change tickets to another day, and split the reservation to different sections, we had to do multiple transactions. If the exchange was on 3 sections of the auditorium, we have to work on 3 separate transaction. May be best to process an exchange at one time - click on exchange, choose multiple sections all at one time.",Overall: Our costumers are happy to reserve their own seats.,
Almost a biased fanboi.... But it's that good.,Jason R.,President,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 19, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Simple to use. Simple to integrate with. Simple to get support. Simple to get feature requests evaluated and even implemented.,"Cons: I'm trying.

I need 100 characters here to justify posting it, but the only problems I've had, there were user forum suggestions to manage, or they addressed them and they are fixed, now.",Overall: Ease of use. Budget friendly... and expandable.,
I have been using ThunderTix for event for just under a year.,Roslyn I.,Education Director,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 22, 2018",4,3,2,4,5,8.0,,"Pros: The price point is great for the service we receive. I like that there is a flat fee and that it does not charge per ticket like most services because some of our tickets are on top of that this is a 25% increase! The scanning feature has been really helpful. Also, I have had all my questions answered quickly when I take the time to ask for help.","Cons: I do not find it easy to use or intuitive. I struggle to navigate the interface every time I get on it. On the scanning tickets end it is easy to use but on the management end it is not easy. Perhaps it will become easier as I use it more. But so far, I am frustrated with it in that way. Also, I do not see easy ways for the system to track the demographics of my customers or features along demographical lines. I wish there was more of this type of feature.","Overall: We use it to sell tickets for all our big major events. It helps us sell tickets and scan people as they arrive when we are expecting 4,000 people!",
That was my first ticket software experience and it was fairly easy to manage. Great support.,Marjolene G.,General Manager,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,"Aug 28, 2017",5,3,4,5,3,9.0,,"Pros: I chose it because of its great layout and number of settings offered for a great price. It is easy to use and generate data report. All patrons were able to use it without problems. Easy to implement it on our website. I received awesome support by chat, email and phone when I had a question and was not able to find the answer online.","Cons: The scanning system of the tickets with phone or tablet did not work AT ALL for us. I had to enter all tickets manually, about 75 per night. Not a big deal because not a lot of tickets, but still anoying, because people printed their tickets, but finally I was just recycling them after checking their names in the guest list.",Overall: Easy and affordable online ticket system (not a lot of choices in our small town). Happy patrons. Other companies requested the name of the product to use it. More independant than using a third party to sell my tickets.,
ThunderTix is easy to use and provides many different options.,Chris E.,Ticket Committee,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 23, 2018",5,5,5,5,3,9.0,,Pros: The thing I like most about Thunder Tix is the easy ticket sales for our events that it offers. Back in the day we took phone orders and had to mail out printed tickets. With Thunder Tix the customer orders their own tickets AND is able to prin them right out. And they can even show the ticket on their phone and we just scan it that way. The ease of use to our ticket helpers is also a benefit. We can view a variety of reports and can search within our order by a variety of different options.,Cons: There is not too much that I do not like about Thunder Tix. At this time I cannot think of any suggestions for upgrades.,,
ThunderTix is hands down the best online Ticketing software I have ever used!!!,Verified Reviewer,Ticket Committee,Construction,Source: GetApp,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 03, 2015",5,5,5,5,3,9.0,"Comments: I use ThunderTix as my online ticketing system for my annual events that do ~5,000+ in online transactions per event. I combine the online system with an Authorize.net gateway payment system. I have used 3 different online ticketing platforms in the past and NOTHING compares to the benefits of ThunderTix. You set it up and maintain it yourself, no waiting for your IT folks to do it for you (nor having to pay for their time), which also means you can change things on the fly as you need to, it integrates easily with Authorize.net (or other payment systems) and you get your money from sales in 1 day, and you just cannot beat their pricing!! And did I mention the excellent customer service? Not only is their online forum very helpful, but when I was in really dire need of real live help, I just emailed them and usually had an answer within a couple hours. All the way around, this software and this company are the BEST and I am so happy to have found them! Will be using this software from here on out!",Pros: Price Ease of Use Set up and Maintenance under my control Excellent and fast customer service Paid fast for sales,Cons: Reporting is a little on the light side and not custom,,
Thundertix,Dan H.,President,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 27, 2012",5,5,5,5,3,9.0,,"Pros: We moved to Thundertix as a way to control our costs in June 2011. Since then, it has been an important key to our business. It streamlined the customer buying experience, it was easy to set up new agents so that we could, in effect, expand office hours, the reports are informative and easy to customize, and customer service has been excellent. The flat monthly rate model works very well for us.","Cons: Need some additional fields in the exported reports so that I can get a better feel for who my customers are, where they come from, how many order online as opposed to over the phone, how much I collect in fees, that sort of thing.","Overall: I highly recommend Thundertix. It's been bullet-proof and we've never received a customer report of downtime. Allowing us to manage costs is crucial for us. We've had experience with Tix, which was also a solid system, but Thundertix is more flexible and saves us money.",
Thunder Tickets serves our needs extremely well and I would recommend their service.,Patrick B.,Controller,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jun 21, 2018",5,5,5,5,3,9.0,,Pros: Ease of use and fast customer service and support.

I am now conducting my second ticket campaign for a chorus with audiences of 300-700.,Ken V.,Ticket Manager,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 23, 2016",4,3,5,5,3,9.0,"Comments: I am a low volume user and not a professional so my learning curve may be slower than usual. Here are a few impressions that I have.

PROS:

1. My contact, Pam Mason, is very prompt and helpful.

2. When things are in place there seems to be no calculation errors of any sort.

3. The reports have lots of valuable information and help us keep up with stats.

4. The ""Forum"" is very helpful.

5. The cost is very fair.

NEEDS:

1. A graphics section to build auditorium maps with.

2. A whole auditorium view to see seat availability without changing screens. This would quicken ""at the door"" sales because customers could choose their seats more easily.

3. More clarity on using email notifications. If there is a cost involved it should show before one has to click the button and decide.

4. A way to run fake credit card test transactions without involving the gateway. This would make it easier to train staff.

5. I have not been able to ""void"" tickets which I should be able to do within 24 hours according to your information.

6. When emailed tickets fail to ""send"" there is no error message.

7. PC computers seem to have glitches in printing. My MacBook allows me to just hit ""Print Tickets"" but my PC seems to have to go back to where I can make the tickets appear as a PDF.

8. The ""See All Dates"" button needs to appear on many pages such as when one is looking at ""Orders"", ""Customers"", etc.",,,,
Great experience with ThunderTix!,KELLY B.,Vice-President/Fundraising,"Fund-Raising, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 01, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: It was extremely reliable -- we needed a precise ticket sales start time, as well as a new wait list feature. The system worked brilliantly. It was very easy to navigate and manage all details, including the ticket format, the guest lists, and more. We look forward to working with ThunderTix on future events as well. Thank you!","Cons: I can't think of anything I liked least...We are in a unique situation in that our tickets sell out within minutes. The only concern was that the event showed up as sold out before it actually was sold out, because ticket purchasers had the tickets in their carts and there has to be a 10 minute hold time before releasing the tickets if they are not purchased. This is understandable.",Overall: Great system and terrific support team!,

You have to go back so many screens to start all over. I wish there was more drop-down menu functions to navigate in less clicks. I wish you could see a seating chart at any point in time via pop-up vs having to leave your transaction when customer asks a seating question.",Overall: Easy to buy tickets but not easy to work the ticket counter for assigned seating shows.,

It is the largest bodybuilding, physique, figure and bikini contests in Hawaii which are both sanctioned by the NPC (National Physique Committee). Both events sell tickets online and ThunderTix helped tremendously by setting up my seating charts and allowing my customers to pick their seats and purchase with a credit card. I am not very tech savvy using computers and their system is user friendly for even a novice like me. The BEST thing about ThunderTix is their customer service! Again, I am not computer literate but whenever I need questions or concerns customer support are alway there to help. They understand their program like a CHAMP! I'm sure there is a lot of features and functionalities that I'm not aware of but, representative always give me suggestions to maximize and improve my business.

We have special events frequently and it's convenient and fast to get the event up and ready for purchase.,Cons: If we need to edit or change something that has already been created it's problematic. It would be nice to have a way to tweak the details of an event even after it has been created.,Overall: It allows us to offer on line purchasing of our events and classes in an accessible way. We can run reports and keep track of sales easily.,
thundertix functionality and support was appropriate for our needs.,Trisha G.,VP of Advancement & External Affairs,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Aug 09, 2017",4,5,4,5,4,9.0,,Pros: Fairly simple to use.

Life saver!,Verified Reviewer,Thundertix administrator and support,Venture Capital & Private Equity,Source: GetApp,NO,Source: Capterra,"Oct 07, 2015",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,"Comments: We were able to set up thundertix in one day and have our entire season up and running, with ticket sales connected to our payment platform instantly. We were taking orders within 24 hours of signing up with Thundertix. The online tutorials are clear and easy to follow. Their customer support is lightening fast in responding. I email them at any hour, even on the weekends, and they return my email extremely fast. There are many ticket platforms out there, and we researched many of them, and tested some of the more popular options. All in all, thundertix has been well worth the cost. We have had ZERO downtime in selling our tickets. Once they are live, the thundertix platform has performed flawlessly. Also, the scanning app they provide is top notch. very fast and snappy. and the hardware they offer is another feature that we have enjoyed: pre-tested hardware integration with clear tutorials and immediate customer support. Just another example of how we have found the costs of the software well worth the benefits to our business. Couldn't be happier with our decision.",Pros: simple setup easy payment setup fast and helpful customer support,"Cons: costs more than some of the alternatives, but that's only relative to other alternatives that offer less. we have found the costs well worth it and have recouped all of the costs quickly given how stable the platform is and how easily it integrates into our sales channels.",,
ThunderTix Review,Natasha G.,Events Cashier,"Hospitality, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 07, 2018",4,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: I like how the app is used easy to use in the sense of updating for both customers and business users, so there is a mutual communication on what we have to offer to them.",Cons: But there is not a description box of the event when you press manage instead you have to go into all of the settings to find the description of any event. If there was a Bloxwich had all the information for customers to read before they purchased the tickets e.g. what would be included at an event? What time the event would start? What things to bring?,Overall: My overall experience with undertakes has been amazing! It has helped me sell tickets quickly and also engage with customers in being able to help their enquiries and their problems as we go through the information they have provided together over the phone or in person.,
"From old platform to event in under a week - 8000 patrons - half a season reprogrammed, flawlessly",Jason R.,President,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 22, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: I never trust ""new user"" reviews because they can be biased by excited new buyer syndrome.

But.... This product impressed me.

Event setup is simple and intuitive. Reports are clear and easy to read. Database import was easy (they imported it for us but required only one edit from my original data). Integration with payment gateway and email service was trivial.

Web interface is modern and clean. Coupons, donations, products are all effortless to create.

Price is excellent.","Cons: Some pages need refreshing after edits, a glitch I am willing to bet is fixed before you read this. Experienced very slight occasional server lag during event definitions, but could easily be internet . Not a problem when purchasing when used as box office terminal.",Overall: Inexpensive event ticketing is no small benefit. Simple interface allows less trained volunteers to make use of it to help run events.,

What was great about ThunderTix was a combination of two things, dependability and customer service. Whenever I had a question they answered it either by phone or email in a timely manner. They were also very thorough as to what you cannot and could do. With much creativity and flexibility there isn't really much you cannot do with their ticketing system.","Pros: It's affordable with its different ticketing plans, and you are not stuck paying an outrageous percentage of your sales. *Customer Service *Dependable *Automated Pre-sale system *Automated Post-sale system *Works on smartphones and tablets with easy. *Promotional tools. *Easy simple buttoning system even low tech Church volunteers of an elderly age were able to operate. *SSL Encryption on their end. *Works with multiple merchant portals","Cons: I am not really sure. They seem to even be concerned about quickly changing their system to benefit you from their open customer support page. You can see what the customers complained about, and even how they solved it. It was freaking incredibly risky, but also awesome to see how they fixed it. So if there are issues which I did not experience, they probably won't last too long.",,

The customer support is very helpful, timely, patient and friendly.","Cons: Our event isn't a concert, but a dinner dance gala, so the inability to sell tables and get tickets for all the seats sold (i.e. a table of 10 meant that we had to generate 9 extra tickets) was frustrating.",Overall: Thundertix has been great to work with. The software responds to our needs and the ability to customise it to suit our needs and configurations is so helpful.,

Customization of each event

Seamless transition from company website

No long term contract",Cons: No percentage based coupon discount (but we hear its in the works),"Overall: Starting up a new theater and our first foray into reserved seat ticketing, Thundertix made the transition almost painless. Everything was explained up front and no question went unanswered. Since our offices at the theater were not completed before opening night, the online capabilities of Thundertix enabled us to run the entire ticketing operation out of a hotel room.

The customer side of things is really clean and well setup.","Cons: The navigation can be non-intuitive, but understandable once you get the lay of the land. The biggest issue we've come across is the inability to delete or archive orders. Our group sales processes including deposits were always in jeopardy of getting really messy on the back end. Even leaving notes about orders that you couldn't later update would get irritating for the small space provided.",Overall: I feel like the biggest benefit is the price and the customization of the software.

Review for Dawn,Jason M.,Owner,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Sep 28, 2012",4,5,5,3,5,10.0,,"Pros: Dawn was great to work with. I'm literate but I learn better with hands on experience.

I know this company has so many tools to become successful and I want to learn them all! It's great! So one day, frustrated I spoke with dawn. She's awesome, helped me understand things, was patient, friendly and I didn't feel like a moron talking to her. Give her a raise and a paid day off.

Very robust, 1000's of tickets can be distributed within minutes of each other without a single issue of duplicate tickets being sold.","Cons: A slight learning curve to find every feature available to admins. This could also be a positive because it is so customizable. At the end of the day, the user can tailor the system to their needs and brand it any way they wish if they are willing to take the time to utilize all features.",Overall: A great web solution to a simple problem... Standing in line for tickets! We are able to act like a company twice our size and distribute 100% electronically thanks to Thundertix. We have been very customers for two years and are looking forward to many more.,

I love that we can include product sales like show posters or tshirts with the ticket purchase. It is very intuitive software. The reporting is AMAZING and we are able to get an accurate record of transactions immediately following the close of a production.,Cons: Nothing I can think of. It has been a great fit for us.,Overall: For years we had general seating and people waiting in line to enter the theatre. Patrons would begin saving rows of seats causing much ill will and frustration. The reporting of ticket sales took much longer to calculate as well.,

"Why use Ticketmaster, when there is ThunderTix?",Matt B.,Director Of Technology,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 01, 2011",5,5,5,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: -ease of use

-extreme flexibility

-extremely customizable

-constantly adding new features

-the best customer service

-puts the most amount of money back in our pockets compared to any other ticketing system we could find",Cons: -custom features can take a while to implement,"Overall: Our venue used to be a ticketmaster shop. We were able to cut our service fees to our customers per ticket by over $2, but still were making 400% more per ticket than we were with ticketmaster. Talk about win/win! Overall profits for our first year of ThunderTix are up 25% just from switching over. We are about to enable facebook sales which should further increase revenue. Stacy Chapman is an unbelievable resource that has been there every step of the way to bend ThunderTix to our needs. I wish all tech companies were as pro and nice to deal with as ThunderTix. If you sell tickets and like to make money, ThunderTix is absolutely the way to go!",
ThunderTix Is Fantastic,Katie M.,Coordinator,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 11, 2015",5,4,5,5,5,9.0,"Comments: The thing that strikes me most about ThunderTix is their incredible customer service. Working with Pam (read: phoning and emailing her incessantly to answer all my inane questions) was a dream. She never made me feel incompetent or silly for asking ANYTHING (even things that could easily be answered by troubleshooting on my end or looking it up on the website), and she was always extremely cordial and willing to give her time to help me. I LOVE the way the website works, and how as an Administrator I can see exactly who is buying tickets, where they are seated, when they bought them, etc., etc., etc. I had all the information about customers that I could want! I love the control I had over which information I wanted to require of my online customers; it was wonderful. So easy to use, and so great to be able to improve upon my skills year after year! I look forward to using ThunderTix for as long as I am involved in Theatre!",,,,

It was easy to review and I liked how the program was Lifetime and updated often. We had a specific limit of seats we could sell and so we were checking it frequently to make sure we did not over sell our event.,Cons: You really had to search around to get reports to print easily. I wish we could have refined exactly what we were looking for and just print that report,Overall: The benefit that we really utilized was keeping track of how many seats we sold so that we would not over sell our event. And also keep track of the revenue we were taking in to make sure the event was going to be prosperous for our non for profit organization. I also like that the fee was not so much that people felt are Booster program wasn't benefiting for the full amount of the ticket.,

Unmatched Service and Response Time,Amanda U.,Office Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 11, 2016",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,Comments: We are a non-profit theater in Arizona. We have been using Thundertix for three years. I spent months researching the different options and I know that I made the right choice. The software is very easy to use and they are always thinking of ways to improve the system. There is an upgrade nearly every month where new features are announced or improved. Our price has never been raised despite the addition of many new features. Pam and the rest of the service team are quick to answer and get things done. Recently a new update feature created a small issue for us. Pam was quick to get the tech team working on a solution for us and before we knew it a new feature had been created just for us. It's a small enough company that you get to talk to an actual person when you call! Imagine that! We couldn't be happier with Thundertix.,,,,

Back then, the Thundertix features were few but we didn't need anything fancy - just a reliable ticketing system that was user friendly. However, it didn't take us long to have a wish list for features, and Dawn and Stacy considered each of our requests regardless of how big or small. They are a fantastic partner to work with, and we always feel like a VIP customer. Now in 2015, they call us to make sure we are aware of new features to help better our customer's experience or minimize our labor.

In 2012, after hefty research on the competition, we switched to ThunderTix for budget reasons, and though it started off a bit bare-bones, the amount of growth and the personalized attention to our needs has been nothing short of stellar.

Newport Walking Tours review,Brad H.,Managing Partner,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 07, 2014",4,4,5,5,4,10.0,Comments: We have been very impressed with the commitment to ongoing improvements by Thundertix. Our company switched to a different ticketing system for almost a year. The reason for the switch was primarily cost driven. The rival service advertised similar features but the reality was far from what was advertised. The customer service was nonexistent with the other company. Thundertix has been very responsive with technical support and advice on how we can improve the ticketing experience for our customers. I would recommend Thundertix to any company that wants a reliable way to sell and manage tickets to their events.,,,,
