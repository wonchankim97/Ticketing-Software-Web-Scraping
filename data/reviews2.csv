ticketsource,My experience of using Ticketsource for setting up Dulwich Players bookings,Kevin E.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,8-Oct-14,4,4,3,3,3,6,"Comments: I have only used Ticketsource two or three times so far, but on the whole I find it a useful and relatively easy to use tool. It took me a little while to get used to it, being mainly a case of trial and error, as there are no real guidance notes; but some advice from a previous user helped considerably. With a bit of experience it is relatively easy to use, although I do have trouble moving between screens to check entries. I also have trouble swapping between data entry and viewing the public screen; it won't always let me view the public side after I have been entering information. It seems to get stuck in one mode at a time.",,,,
ticketsource,Reliable and efficient,Maxine H.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,11-Jan-17,5,5,4,5,3,6,"Comments: We have been using Ticketsource for at our theatre for approximately 5 years now. The system works well for our customers who can book seats at a time that suits them and we do not have to be on site to take bookings. As a small venue this is very cost effective for us as we do not have to staff a 24hour box office. Our staff we find the systems straightforward and reliable. We have all the booking details at our fingertips, so we are able to answer customer queries efficiently. Archive materials are easily accessible which makes financial reconciliation straightforward and transparent.We are able to link directly to our website and can also benefit from the wider Ticketsource community on line.Ticketsource allows us to customise each event to our own needs allowing us to create tailor made seating plans, pricing structures and booking discounts and incentives. We can add information and publicity material to each performance.Customer support is very good with a number of options including FAQ's to assist with basic problems, an on line help facility and a telephone help line. The site also includes very helpful tutorials for setting up events and trouble shooting, which are brief and not at all patronising.Ticketsurce also allows us to run our own box office at strategic times and as much of our business is from schools, dance schools and local amateur companies within a small radius of the venue, it means that customers have the option not to get involved in the extra cost of booking fees.It would help us greatly as a venue if there were an option to print off whole shows with all the ticket prices on one ticket, as many amateur groups who sell within their own small community like to take possession of all the tickets to sell directly. I am aware that this does not benefit Ticketsource and would make accounting for ticket sales impossible, but many of our clients would prefer to have multiple prices on each ticket, enabling them to highlight the price paid or to cross off the other prices. I'm not sure if other venues would benefit from this service and I fully appreciate that we may be in the minority.I would certainly recommend Ticketsource to venues of all sizes as it really is a complete package. The rates are reasonable and the support is excellent",,,,
ticketsource,Outstanding,Michael H.,Theatre Coordinator,,,NO,Source: Capterra,8-Oct-14,5,5,4,5,3,6,"Comments: We have been using TicketSource as our sole provider for Box Office solutions now for just over a year.

ticketsource,Hard to fault TicketSource,Paul K.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,11-Jan-17,5,4,5,5,5,10,Comments: I have been using TicketSource for 18 months and once you get to understand what the various options are and how to deal with the charges (fee added on in full or fixed amount etc) it is simplicity itself to use thereafter. Help is at hand if you don't understand the online instructions. Copying and then amending an existing event to create a new event makes life very easy as you do not have to enter all the regular details each time. Reporting is excellent on both customers and event ticket sales and having emails when there has been a sale is an excellent facility to keep track of progress on ticket sales.,,,,
ticketsource,Amazing!,Paul T.,Chairman,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,17-Jul-19,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: This Box Office system is amazing, works perfectly, and support is first class.","Cons: Nothing really, it does everything that is required",,
ticketsource,Wonderful service,Paul K.,Events Coordinator,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,8-Oct-14,5,4,5,5,5,10,"Comments: TS is one of those rare services that delivers exactly what it says. For a small arts organisation that is always looking for cost-effective solutions, TS has proved invaluable to us. It is easy to use, provides a variety of information in formats that can be exported to our other systems and flexible enough to not only serve as an in-house box office, but also as an on-line customer service which can be managed off-site by our volunteers - everything we need.Its customer service is truly outstanding. On the rare occasions when we have had to contact them with a technical issue it is resolved quickly and efficiently. Sometimes we have asked for slight changes to made to the system and, when possible, these have always been made.The only small criticism I would make is with regard to the ticket printer which every now and again stops working. This seems to be caused by a problem with the printer cache which, because it is not on our network, has to be cleared by TS. Again, technical support resolves this quickly and has made suggestions for preventing future problems.",,,,
ticketsource,Fantastic service!,Mat R.,General Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,1-Jan-15,5,5,5,5,5,10,"Comments: I don't often leave feedback when asked, but I thought I would this time.",,,,
ticketsource,Good overall but needs some work to be amazing,Joseph H.,Owner,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,9-Oct-14,4,3,5,4,5,10,"Comments: The service is great and fairly easy to use, I particularly like the options to customise the landing page with your personal banners. Customers who are issued tickets have commented how easy it is to use and The paper ticket service is faultless and great value for the purchaser.",,,,
ticketsource,Capitals Hockey,Scott N.,Director,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,8-Oct-14,4,3,5,5,5,10,"Comments: 1, Good customer service and very helpful to provide solutions and ideas to suit the clients needs2. Simple to use system, however we still have issues with the scanners and collation of scanned users3. Versatile product - but the functionality to allow the client to associate a bar code with a particular seat for Season Ticket holders would be useful. For example we need bar codes printed onto cards before a person has chosen an actual seat.4. Competition is growing from other similar companies offering to charge ticket commissions of 5% and payments made as they are purchased by the customer - From our company viewpoint we are very happy with Ticketsource but we have to evaluate options, especially commercial ones that serve our customers and cash flow better from a commercial standpoint.",,,,
ticketsource,Great software but still room to grow.,Rebecca D.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,11-Jan-17,4,3,3,5,5,10,"Comments: In general, I like this software. It does the basics of ticket provision well and is easy to use from a ticket buying customer point of view.",,,,
ticketsource,Ticket Source Review,Paul F.,Organiser,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,8-Oct-14,4,5,3,5,5,10,Comments: Ticket Source is a very able ticket sales solution for events (we use if for a Fireworks event). It has lots of functionality and flexibility which is what we need. The only con I can think of this that it's a bit expensive in terms of the cut Ticketsource take from sales - we're a non-profit / fundraising event and we would have hoped that Ticketsource would have let us keep more of the profits for the charity donations we make from the proceeds of the event.,,,,
ticketsource,Must-have Ticketing Software for Small Venues,Luke B.,House Manager,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,7-Oct-14,5,5,3,5,5,10,"Comments: When we decided to open up the then Writhlington School theatre as a small professional venue, a robust box office system was essential. The venue was run by one full time and one part time staff, so minimising effort was very important for us. TicketSource makes everything so easy. It took less than an hour for us to set up the system, from scratch, including seating plans, venue details box office front-end and Facebook integration. Customer support from TicketSource has also been first rate. One one occasion, I had to phone them an hour before a show went up and they quickly resolved my problem over the phone.",,,,
ticketsource,I Love TicketSource,Omar P.,CEO/Founder,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,11-Oct-14,4,3,3,5,5,10,"Comments: I use ticket source for 90% of my events. I found them via The Pumphouse Children's Theatre in Watford UK, and have been singing there praises ever since.",,,,
ticketsource,Resolving trouble tickets was never so easy,Vijay K.,Lead Recruiter,"Computer Software, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,4-Apr-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: they have a very systematic solution and addressing the user data for the ticket collected and resolve it with the very fastest and reliable way possible.,Cons: Submitting the ticket in the system is a little slow if they have a huge queue. i suggest an improvement there if they can.,,
ticketsource,"Ticket software fine, customer service seriously lacking",Nicholas F.,Founder,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,8-Oct-14,4,4,5,1,5,10,"Comments: Ticket software was fine, analytics were useful, not particularly stand out amongst competition, what did make ticketsource stand out was the availability of ticket scanning hardware, unfortunately hardware did not work (most importantly incorrect charger for base station laptop), causing a great deal of extra work during the event and cost of temporary universal charger to get the thing to work. Faultiness of charger then completely denied by customer service, will not be using ticketsource again, is ridiculous after they made around å£1300 from the event.",,,,
ticketsource,great overall but room for improvements,amber c.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,11-Jan-17,4,4,4,4,5,10,"Comments: Great back end functions etc but interface is a little ugly especially on mobile devices. Wish could bulk update events, i.e. if change general terms and conditions, it's very painstaking to indiv modify each upcoming event. We really use the public facing ticket remaining function, it would be great if this was visible on mobile view and not just desktop.",,,,
ticketsource,Hassle free experience from start to finish.,Phil Y.,Director of Performance,"Education Management, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,17-Jul-17,5,4,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Once set up, this software takes most of the trouble associate with ticketing away. The interface is fairly self explanatory and if things do get confusing the help site is both intuitive and informative.There was no claim process, as soon as the event was over funds were credited to our accounts and there was a full detailed report regarding every transaction.","Cons: The initial planning is a little long winded. I would like the ability to customise the seating plan layout further. There's nothing wrong with the current set up, I'd just like to be able to configure it to look like my theatre.",Overall: Took away the hassle of ticketing almost completely.,
ticketsource,Very good ticket selling software,Sharad G.,Team Lead,"Computer Software, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,21-Mar-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: they are very user friendly and we have always got positive remarks and cheers from our customers.

ticketsource,Great for customers and for us!,Shirley J.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,11-Jan-17,5,4,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: We've been using TicketSource for many years now and the customer service team are exceptionally good at getting you started, helping to iron out kinks and give support when needed. However, the system is really intuitive and easy to use. They have added extra functions over the years and it feels very bespoke given how it can be adapted to different venues and events. I feel it is by far the most friendly and easy to use system out there.",Cons: The only thing (as a charity) we don't like is that any donations also get a surcharge as it feels like a heavy penalty on people's generosity over and above what they pay for their ticket fee.,,
ticketsource,Live Music!,Ian S.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,11-Jan-17,5,5,4,5,5,10,"Comments: I've been using Ticketsource for nearly four years with a Live music project in the Yorkshire Dales. the system allows multiple venues to be stored so setting up a gig is as simple as copy event and change the band name. I use a bar code scanner at event which makes entry easy and looks awesome. most of my guests just use the home printed tickets and the system alerts if someone tries to cheat. Support is great, but hardly had had to use it. it works best with wifi access at the venues but can be ran off line if down loaded once online ticket sales close. A great advantage it that cash sales pre event can be entered free of charge for those guests without internet. The only disadvantage is the sales payment is not made until the Wednesday after a weekend event which effects cash flows if you have a expensive band to pay on the night. In conclusion its a fab system which is easy to use and sell tickets online, hopefully I will be using Ticketsource for years to come.",,,,
ticketsource,A great ticketing company!,Rihanon H.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,12-Jan-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,"Comments: This is the second time we have used TicketSource and this time round it has been great! Last year we had a couple of problems that didn't help the way we handled our tickets but we went back with ways of how they could improve and their technical team worked together to help us. With their help we were able to sell our tickets with no problems at all. The back of house system worked really well for us, as a company we sell lots of different ticket types and its important to be able to pull off reports, check customers details and doing this with TicketSource was very easy. If we had any questions or were struggling to set up the event the customer support was brilliant and very helpful! As we are a seasonal event we only use TicketSource for a certain amount of time but we will certainly be returning to use them again. Highly recommend!",,,,
ticketsource,General review,hannah t.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,12-Jan-17,4,3,3,5,5,10,"Comments: The customer support was great, I especially liked the fact the team could view how I had set up our event page and provide step by step advice. The FAQ's on the website were helpful too.",,,,
ticketsource,Excellent resource for ticket selling,Christine R.,Secretary,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,8-Oct-14,5,3,3,5,5,10,"Comments: My amateur dramatic society have no need to look elsewhere in order to sell tickets for our annual pantomime. Should we have any questions or queries there is someone to come to our aid either by phone, online chat or email. The customer service personnel are very patient and helpful.As someone who has limited understanding of technical knowhow I can get frustrated when trying to follow tutorials as there can be points that look simple enough but I get myself into difficulties. I seem to find things can't be completed as easily as TicketSource would think. I am someone who has to to have every move clearly explained and not assumed we know what to do - hence for me 3 Stars.",,,,
ticketsource,Absolutely Ideal for Amateur Theatre Groups,Laurie R.,Chairman,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,9-Oct-14,4,4,3,4,5,10,"Comments: The TicketSource site is quite the best I have found for on-line booking for our shows. We are just starting to accept bookings on line and were very nervous about the things that could go wrong leaving our customers frustrated and angry. I am pleased to say that nothing like this has happened and the feedback we have had so far is very favourable. The reports that are readily available keep us in control of the sales and monitor their progress. The detailed financial reports and the prompt payment of receipts are a boon to our treasurer. I particularly like the way we can integrate the on-line sales with our over the counter sales as many of our older patrons are uneasy about using computers to buy things on-line.The facilities in the software range from very simple to the most elaborate you could imagine.I would not hesitate to recommend this site to any Amateur Groups.",,,,
ticketsource,Cygnet Players Review,Katy G.,Deputy Chairman,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,8-Oct-14,4,4,3,3,5,10,Comments: I think Ticketsource is a very good website for amateur companies to use. The seating plan side of things is quite difficult to create but once you have the main template for your theatre its great that this is added top you account and reused.,,,,
ticketsource,Great service!,Charlie C.,Director of Finance,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,8-Oct-14,5,4,3,5,5,10,"Comments: We've been using TicketSource for a few years now for our amateur theatre, and have been very happy with the service. It's pretty simple to use, and a lot of extra functionality has been added since we started using it. Unlike Microsoft, however, they don't completely rewrite the interface every time they make a change! One of the unexpected side-effects of migrating to online ticketing is that, because they can see how many tickets are still available, our patrons often leave it to the last minute before booking, which gives some directors sleepless nights!In our experience, customer service has been brilliant. We haven't experienced many problems, but any issues or questions raised have alway been dealt with very promptly, and the technical staff seem to very be open to sensible changes requested by their customers.",,,,
ticketsource,Great Service,Mark F.,Chairman,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,8-Oct-14,5,4,3,4,5,10,Comments: This is such a useful service for small organisations who want to sell tickets over the internet. We are a small amateur drama society who do no more than å£4000 a year ticket revenue but find it is well worth while. It is very flexible and if you are reasonably comfortable with using the web it should not take more than an hour to learn how to use it.,,,,
ticketsource,"User-friendly, pro quality ticketing site",Mark N.,Musician,"Entertainment, Self-employed",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,9-Feb-17,5,5,5,5,4,10,,Pros: It is comprehensively able to take care of all of my needs.,Cons: My previous criticisms were answered satisfactorily by customer services.,"Overall: Ticketsource has all the functionality I could possibly want from a ticketing site, and is user-friendly to boot. I run uk based events and find it far superior to any other ticketing site I've used. The fees are reasonable, especially for higher priced events. Would thoroughly recommend.","Recommendations to other buyers: No... use it, it's great."
ticketsource,Very pleased!,Rose -Marie O.,Programming/marketing officer,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,7-Oct-14,5,5,5,5,4,10,"Comments: I have been using ticket source on behalf of The Kings Hall and can say just how pleased I am with the service. It's very easy to use - customers have given great feedback and I've been able to edit events with no fuss. On a couple of occasions I have called the help line and they have been very quick to answer - no long waits which is so often the case with other companies and they have been able to advise and sort my question straight away. If I have to mention an improvement I would only say it would be good to see our events go out in their Twitter feeds occasionally. Overall, top marks!",,,,
ticketsource,Good but customer service could be improved.,Annabelle L.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,12-Jan-17,4,4,4,3,4,10,"Comments: I find you site easy to use once you know what you are doing but it would be nice if there is a guide on how to use Ticket Source. If there is already one, I couldn't find it so you might want to make it easily accessible especially when people first sign up.",,,,
ticketsource,Excellent ticketing experience for us!,Benoy I.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,2-Feb-17,5,4,5,5,4,10,"Comments: We've just used ticketsource for our first event and it was a fantastic experience for our admin users and our clients using it to book the event. Easy to setup, simple to use and it has some great features too. The only two improvements I would suggest is with the free scanning app for iOS and Android where it was sometimes a 'hit & miss'. The other improvement could be with the 'refund' process where one can only refund in full and part refund requires ringing in to their support rather than having to deal with it ourselves online. But overall it was an excellent experience for us and we will certainly be using them again! Highly recommended!",,,,
ticketsource,Penarth Operatic & Dramatic Society,Michael J.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,11-Jan-17,5,5,5,5,4,10,"Comments: As a society we started using TicketSource a few years when we started our website.We were told about it by another local company ( Concept Players ) and I was charged with finding out what they could for us. I went to the website and the site was simple and informative and within minutes I had all information for me to advise the committee about it. The commttee deceided to use them and I was instructed to to go ahead and I then went back to the website and within minutes I had arranged an account and it did not take long to get our tickets online. The tickets sell well and we can get all the information about our ticket sales and at the end of the sales period the money is transfered to our bank account with no fuss.It would be fair to say that they offer a first class service with no fuss and if you need any help then it is only an email or phone call to get it sorted.",,,,
ticketsource,Bath beer festival boost,Martin A.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,11-Jan-17,5,5,5,5,4,10,"Comments: I researched reviews of on-line ticketing services before selecting TicketSource to sell beer festival tickets, based on the experience of other Campaign for Real Ale users. Even though I was a first time user of on-line ticketing, I was pleased by the ease with which I could set up details for the event. I used the system at a basic level but there is plenty of scope for more sophistication, for example, bar code scanning. Over 70% of our tickets were sold via TicketSource.",,,,

Reports were easy to generate. It was extremely easy to make alterations to people's bookings, or recover customer details.

ticketsource,Overall ticket source did exactly what I required and I'm very happy.,Darren P.,DJ,,,NO,Source: Capterra,1-Jan-16,5,4,5,5,5,10,"Comments: I did a bit of searching on the internet before eventually going with ticket source. You only know at the end of the process whether it was a good decision or not, and I can say now that I'm at the end, it was a good decision. I'm a fairly competent user of IT software and found my way around everything ok. I've marked it down to a very good 4 stars on 'ease of use' as I feel that it probably could be just a little bit more user friendly to people who aren't IT literate.

ticketsource,Great Ticket Facility but...,Rob M.,Chairman,,,NO,Source: Capterra,7-Oct-14,4,5,4,5,5,10,Comments: Overall I find Ticket Source excellent and find website integration very easy. An option or tick box of what events to be listed to the site would be an bonus as we like to great tickets for competition or complimentary tickets but if you create an event for free tickets they will automatically be listed on our website - I hope that makes sense.,,,,
ticketsource,New user of the Ticket Source system,Alison W.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,12-Jan-17,5,4,4,5,5,10,"Comments: We had to set up our own system in late summer following the closure of our previous outlet and as Ticket Source had come highly recommended to us by a smaller user we decided to try it. The system is easy to set up, even for the complicated ticketing systems we need for some venues. Once in place, it is easy to adjust and, more importantly, our end users find it easy to use. The reports are excellent and one key area we have never been able to look at in detail before is our marketing. We are now able to target the right places for marketing our events to ensure maximum take-up of tickets. Overall we are very happy with our first few months of using Ticket Source",,,,
ticketsource,Outdoor event using downloaded database and scanner,Derek L.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,11-Jan-17,5,5,4,5,5,10,"Comments: The event sold around 200 tickets with differing values.We knew that the customers would all arrive in a short period of time so we opted to buy a scanner and use this linked to a downloaded customer database on a laptop.The system worked fine for 10mins then started to freeze but with a reset worked again. This occurred several times. I'm not sure if it was the laptop or scanner/connection that was at fault but without doing another event will not know.That aside, the system worked well and the ticket that I made purposely void was met with a loud refusal bleep.Overall the system is good and kept a large sum of money in electronic transfers rather than cash on the gate.Recommended.",,,,

The majority of our tickets are sold through TicketSource and some through a mobile phone that we man ourselves. We have had very few problems and the helpline has been very helpful when we have. The TicketSource website is not mobile phone friendly and we have asked if a mobile phone App could be developed but I understand there are no plans to do so at present. Otherwise it works extremely well for us.,,,,

I am very happy to give help and advice to any potential customers with similar theatres. We transferred to Ticketsource 3 years ago and have seen our online ticket sales increase to about 60%. This saves a huge amount of volunteer time in dealing with ticket sales. The support has been first class with prompt replies to emails and fixes for most of the problems and individual requests eg for membership numbers to be included.

The site is easy to use and customer support is friendly and very helpful - not that you'll need it very often.

TicketSource is great giving you a great deal of flexibility - far more than we, a small local amateur dramatic society, need! Ticket sales are easy for our clients, and we receive a daily sales list to keep us up to date with how they are going. We then get a compilation list for each evening to use in the box office.

Customers have to choose a seat price before seeing the plan which I don't like, but otherwise the customer experience is OK.

ticketsource,Charney Church,Pam E.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,11-Jan-17,4,4,4,5,5,10,"Comments: On the whole it's really good. Ticket bookings (ie when they are paid for) works better than reservations. When I reserve tickets it doesn't always send a ""reservation e-mail"" to those making the reservation and it is difficult to change a reservation to a confirmed booking. I now get around it by completely cancelling the reservation and starting a new booking, this does however make the reports a little confusing and take a little more time than I would like.

TicketSource is by far the best solution. The interface is fairly intuitive.

Customer service was good, I didn't have any issues to report but just after I set up the event, I got a call advising of some other options I could use within the event page for ticketing (which was very useful!)

ticketsource,Great product and great product support,Bob S.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,11-Jan-17,5,3,4,5,5,10,Comments: My only negative is: we usually have a different layout in our auditorium for each of our 5 plays and we offer a password early booking week for members.
