myboxoffice.us,Invaluable to our organization. Every aspect from beginning to end was superior.,Martha L.,Administrative Director,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jan 18, 2016",5,5,nan,5,nan,nan,"Comments: It would be hard for me to find any cons with MyBoxOffice and the use of its online ticketing system to sell tickets to our annual Nutcracker production. From beginning to end, the process was smooth and instrumental to our production's success. Florin, our direct contact with MyBoxOffice, not only helped us with sales but the marketing of our production. His guidance and suggestions were a big part of our 2015 Nutcracker season be our most successful in our organization's history. He was readily available to answer any questions from our staff as well as customers buying tickets to our performances. In addition, he was at every one of our performances assisting patrons and selling additional tickets. He is a gem. Our organization surveyed our families that were involved in our production and the overall satisfaction rate using the online ticketing system was superior. The convenience and easy process to purchase tickets was very much appreciated. The bonus of being able to select their own seats and print tickets from home was mentioned most from our families as to why they loved using this software. Not only was the use of the software and online process advantageous but assisted us with timing of performances as well over 90% of tickets were purchased in advance so there were no long lines at the box office on performance days. My organization cannot recommend MyBoxOffice enough. We will certainly be using them again not only for our Nutcracker season but other upcoming performances as well.",,,,

This is a GREAT aspect. Also, the ticket printer works flawlessly, making our ticketing process so much more professional than in the past.","Cons: There are SO many options in each drop-down menu (we only use a few in our small operation) that the process can seem daunting at first to our volunteers, but with training they see how simple our system really is.","Overall: We decided on My Box Office when we decided to move into online ticketing for our small theater. They gave us flexibility in that some of our shows are General Admission, some are Reserved Seating, and some use other venues with different seating requirements. This software works for all of those options, and customer service has been great in helping us figure out how to make it all work, even with flexible wheelchair seating spaces! They helped us set up the credit card processing and that has been very smooth. Our Reserve Seating, night-of-show box office functionality has never been smoother!","Recommendations to other buyers: Our Customer Service Rep, Florin, is great to work with - immediately responsive when I have a question, and I can unreservedly recommend this product to anyone needing online ticketing services."
