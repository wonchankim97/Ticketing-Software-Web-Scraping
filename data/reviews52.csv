roller software,"Excellent Customer support, easy to use software",Michael R.,Software Support,"Leisure, Travel & Tourism, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Dec 05, 2018",5,5,4,5,nan,9.0,,Pros: One of Roller's biggest assets is its team. If you have a problem or a training issue they are nearly always available on the phone and if they can't help straight away they will look into it.,Cons: Reporting is probably Rollers biggest set back for us. While it delivers the basics running several sites reports individually can be time consuming and if you don't pay attention to the fields you are using can lead to inconsistencies. (There is however a patch in the works to integrate these down the line).,Overall: Roller makes the life simple for the customer and is constantly seeking to improve. They are receptive to feedback and will try to act on it within reason. They have improved as an operator over the time we have used them and continue to seek to offer more to the market opposed to becoming stagnant or ignoring glitches like other software providers we have previously used.,
