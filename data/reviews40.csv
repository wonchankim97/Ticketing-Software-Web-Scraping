glitnir ticketing system,Great product and great customer support!,Lance K.,"Manager, Ticket Operations and Season Sales","Sports, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 25, 2019",4,5,5,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: Glitnir is relatively easy to teach anyone new. Value for the product is great! If we need any assistance or something quits working, they're staff will jump on a call right away. Our rep is always great at getting back to us in a timely manner and solving any and all problems. The group portal upgrades were much needed and I think they nailed it. Much easier to use and much quicker to set up/maintain. I also like that CRM is build right in, so no need to purchase through another company.","Cons: Reports and running lists are not the easiest. Took me a while to figure out how to pull info I need. Also, from time to time, if I select what I need (seeing holds for an event/solds/ect.) still no information shows. Seems like there's a list for everything you would want/need, just figuring out the best and most convenient ones is key. The last thing would be any individual seats in a customers cart that are trying to get deleted. Other systems all you need to do is click on the seat to select, and click again to delete from your cart. With Glitnir you need to click on the seat to select, and on the right hand side, check the box on the seat you do not want, then select delete. Seems like this is something they could upgrade.",Overall: Overall it's been a great experience. The Glitnir team is always looking for ways to improve and evolve. Customer service has been exceptional from all team members. We've also seen our online ticket sales grow from year to year using Glitnir.,
glitnir ticketing system,Glitnir Ticketing Exeter City,Denis L.,IT & Process Manager,"Sports, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 26, 2019",5,4,5,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: The flexibity, accountability, cost and serviceability. The dedication of the Glitnir to solve challenges in the ever changing UK ticketing arena has been second to none. The market differs significantly from the US model with events where demand regularly outstrips capacity - the team developed an easy solution to control who can buy and when without any compromise to response times online and the robust financials that underpin the service. The innovative integration with Google to deliver the online customer ability to walk around the venue, see 360 view and then choose seat is exceptional.",Cons: The robust engine that underpins the service needs a comprehensive administration back to end that enables user management but at first is a little daunting. The team have done some major improvements and continues to provide a better interface. As this only affects a couple of people in th organisation this is only a minor irritant.,"Overall: Our experience over the past 5 years has seen the system deliver increased sales, massive improvements in customer service, cost reductions and flexibility to enable the company to grow quicker than expected. The user online service, event scanning and adaptability have made a significant contribution to the clubs migration from an old style sports club into a dynamic 21st century business encompassing and embracing the modern online and mobile services.",
glitnir ticketing system,15 year user of Glitnir Ticketing System,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Sports, 201-500 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Mar 19, 2019",4,4,4,5,nan,8.0,,Pros: I've always like the straight forward approach with Glitnir. There are generally multiple ways to access the info you're looking for. Step by step is as simplified as it can get and selling tickets to games is full proof.,Cons: It isn't too user friendly. I'm used to it but new users say it is complicated to learn and the overall theme the online purchaser reports is that it is tough to work through. Figuring out how to generate certain reports can be complicated or tricky because there is so much functionality that it becomes confusing.,"Overall: I've always been a fan of Glitnir Ticketing. I've worked with their ownership since my first day on the job and they are a very hands on company and will quickly assist you with any problems. I can't stress that enough, you can email or call and they will promptly work directly with you to figure out the problem or guide you through the steps. Well run company and they worked hard, with me, to quickly address our issues and customize our system to fit our exact needs and wants. They want our system to be the best it can be and make every effort to make it so.",
glitnir ticketing system,Customer Support At It's Finest,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Sports, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Mar 22, 2019",4,4,3,5,5,7.0,,"Pros: I do love the customer service aspect that I've come to rely on, on nearly a daily basis. All of the representatives and executives that I have worked with over the six years I have used Glitnir Ticketing have been readily available to me and the organization 24/7.","Cons: There are a lot of competitors that are offering new and shiny technology. In my opinion Glitnir is not on the forefront of that yet, but they are making strides to get there. I've seen vast improvements in the group ticketing platform, season ticket platform and email platform over the past year, and I am excited to see what comes next.","Overall: Glitnir has been very responsive to our wants in needs. They've been able to help us modify our reporting, improved the group portal platform, and as I said earlier, have the best customer service/support team that I have worked with.",
glitnir ticketing system,Glitnir Review,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Sports, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Mar 19, 2019",4,5,4,4,5,7.0,,"Pros: Glitnir's ease of use software is superb for our industry! We've been using them for some time now and once everything was up to speed, the buying process was simple! The features they offer are exactly what we were looking for from the buying process, to the CRM, to the Group Portal and newsletter features. The customer service is great! They usually stay on top of all the details.","Cons: The most difficult task is trying to find the report that you are looking for to pull the most accurate information. They offer a wide variety of reports, so there may be one that works just right for you! There are some bugs with the software (not bad) that take time getting use to.","Overall: Switching to a new ticket system is like learning how to walk again. It was tough at first, but the customer support was there every step of the way. Their buying process helped our speed of service, data collection and simplified a lot of things we were doing. The FREE CRM is a great added bonus, along with the group portal.",
glitnir ticketing system,Relentlessly Helpful Customer Support Unlocks Glitnir's Full Potential,Karl M.,Director of Ticket Operations,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Aug 12, 2010",4,5,nan,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: One of the most impressive things about the Suns' partnership with Glitnir has been our success advertising and selling more than just cut-and-dry individual-game tickets through the online system. I've been amazed at the number of new customers we've brought in who have been able to take advantage of some of our unique ticket promotions without having ever spoken to a member of our ticket sales team. Glitnir's Promo Code setup is so user-friendly that we have literally been selling our popular Chipotle Friends & Family packages in our sleep, racking up sales of our most popular ticket package long after the box office closes. We've sold out all four of our Friends & Family games so far this season, largely because Glitnir's Promo Codes make purchasing the plan online so quick and convenient.","Cons: When I first started using Glitnir, I would keep a running list of what I thought were problems with the system -- things that seemed flawed or that just didn't seem to work with what we do here in Hagerstown. As I worked more and more with my Glitnir representatives, though, and they took the time to walk me through each and every ""problem"" I brought up, the list dwindled. At this point, there really are no problems with the system as far as I am concerned. It took me some time and hard work to get comfortable with the Glitnir system, but all the effort was rewarded because at this point I feel like Hagerstown has a ticketing system that suits us perfectly.",Overall: I would recommend Glitnir to any user that wants to get more than just the bare bones out of their ticketing system -- anyone who is willing to put in some work so that they can feel totally comfortable with their system and capable of using it to enhance all elements of ticket operations.,
glitnir ticketing system,Glitnir Ticketing Review,Patrick S.,Box Office Manager,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Aug 23, 2010",4,4,nan,4,nan,nan,,"Pros: The customer service has been very good. Gordan, DJ and Ian all put in extra hours to make certain that we were up and ready to roll after having imstalled the system 5 weeks prior to our opening day. They have fielded phone calls on weekends, checked out problems for us after hours and made certain everything was in proper working order before signing off on the job.",Cons: Online ticket customers can leave single seats from a transaction. This has been my biggest fault with the system. Our stadium is not that large and on busy nights we will use every reserved seat that we have so eliminating singles is huge for us.,"Overall: The Glitnir Ticketing System is a solid tool. For mid to low budget teams looking to have their customer database coupled with their ticket system, I feel it is one of the strongest on the market, presenting great value in addition to it's ease of use.",
glitnir ticketing system,"Glitnir Ticketing is an easy to use, affordable and a great ticket solution!",Eben Y.,Vice President,"Entertainment, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 18, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Easy to use, navigate, run the necessary reports I need as well as keep up to date on where I am with ticket sales on a particular event. Great for keeping information on my customers that allows me to grow sales for other events.","Cons: I really haven't had any issues with this software. To be honest, anytime I ran into a limitation I brought it to their attention and they solved the issue for me.",Overall: I've personally worked with Glitnir Ticketing for about 15 years and I wouldn't want to work with anyone else. Any time I had an idea that would help grow sales they worked to implement. They have helped me with creating custom reports. It is an easy ticket solution for our customers which leaves them happy and they don't feel like they got hit with a lot of unnecessary fees that you may see with a larger ticketing solution.,
glitnir ticketing system,Glitnir Ticketing System review,Conor J.,Ticket and Operations Coordinator,"Sports, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 02, 2019",4,5,4,5,4,9.0,,Pros: We had absolutely no ticketing presence or software before Glitnir. The customer service and helpful attitude they provided was and is fantastic. They worked with us through the entire set up process and really set us up for success and continue to respond immediately even when we have the smallest questions or issues.,"Cons: I still find the navigation and orientation to the system a little difficult. It may be because no one here has ever used a system like this. However I find it difficult to teach my workers (mostly students) and administrators how to use the system and for game day sales and even more difficult to show them how to access other features.

That being said, the Glitnir team did a great job showing me how to use it and my translation to others may need improvement.","Overall: There is a legitimacy in our department and in our ticketing that wasn't there before. Online and walk up sales are easier to manage and quicker to execute, and reporting sales and attendance is easier and more consistent.",
glitnir ticketing system,Ticketing With Glitnir,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Sports, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Mar 19, 2019",4,4,4,5,nan,8.0,,"Pros: Glitnir makes game day walk up sales simple, quick, and easy. I also enjoy the CRM system when it comes to logging and keeping track of conversations with clients and potential business. Learning and understanding the system more makes Glitner a fun easy to use ticketing system.","Cons: Sometimes subtracting tickets in a group order can be difficult process however as well as some of the inner workings however, I am still learning a lot of the system.","Overall: I have used Glitnir for the better part of a year and a half now and as of October 2018 I began to learn a lot about the Administrative side to their ticketing system. Whenever I am unsure of certain actions or in need some additional training, Glitnir's Customer Service Support has no problem providing training guides as well as tremendous over the phone support. The more I learn about the system the easier it is to navigate moving forward.",

The CRM helps us keep track of progress and leads.,Cons: Freedom to create inventory on the fly.
