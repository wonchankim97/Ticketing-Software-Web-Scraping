via,A true collaborator and partner,Lyndsey J.,,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Oct 27, 2016",5,5,5,5,nan,nan,"Comments: The Edinburgh Fringe Box Office has been powered by Red61's VIA software since 2009, and in collaboration we have gone from strength to strength, distributing over 2.5 million tickets for the Festival Fringe 2016. The strength of the collaboration lies in the teams unending passion for the success of the Festival Fringe and the quality of service and software provided. We couldn't operate at the scale we do without the advanced networking capabilities that allow us to operate a multi user, multi tenant box office network across the city, which holds the experience of the customer at its heart. Red61 have been integral to the development of a seamless purchase/collection system that means customers spend less time queuing for tickets and more time enjoying the festival. High performing real time reporting means venues and companies can maximise their sales right up to the show starting, and with over 3,000 shows per year taking part in the Fringe Festival this last minute market is vital to the income generation abilities of companies and artists. The system is ridiculously easy to use, which means we save time and money training staff and it's intuitive interface means even those staff who are not regular users and quickly able to achieve their objectives. The support team are, in the main, made up of ex box office managers, meaning they bring a unique perspective to both the functionality of the system and the needs of its (often demanding) customers.

Reporting

Connection with Antech, Sound, etc","Cons: It is client-centric rather than pet-centric, meaning we cannot distinguish between multiple pet visits with different causes without a lot of backup work.

Getting locked in single user mode.","Overall: Setup was time consuming but setting it up right is worth the time. When training, support was supreme. Once training ended, customer support was not as strong.",

This past year the Red61 team helped implement ticketless solutions with iPads and cell phone scanners at the door of venues to great success. Our patrons loved scanning their cell phones and pass cards and the Red61 team was excellent at trouble shooting any problems that arose quickly and efficiently. Highly recommend Red61.",Pros: Familiar with it,Cons: Support,Overall: Have had system since 2003. Liked system. No problem. Needed to update server and new updates. Did so.

via,Extremely poor costumer service,Kay H.,Owner/Vetrrinarian,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Feb 24, 2015",1,2,nan,1,nan,nan,Comments: I have used Via for 13 years and was overall pleased with product However to do the update I was informed that I would have to purchase all new computers as well as new software to the tune of 15000 +++. I did so. I was told I was getting the version 8.0 when I actually got 7.0 which did nothing that I wasn't able to do with my old software except that it doesn't work properly. When I can talk to someone they simply say it is a glitch in the program which would be fixed by 8.0. I was told 8.0 would be out in 2 weeks then next month then next month and so on. Well it came out 5 months later. They installed and now half of our computers don't work at all. No one other than our salesman will return my calls and let me know what is going or what they are going to do. So now i am going to be forced to spend more money and hire an attorney. I would recommend this software company to my worst enemy.,Pros: Familiar with it,Cons: Support,Overall: Have had system since 2003. Liked system. No problem. Needed to update server and new updates.
