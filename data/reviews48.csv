wintix / webtix,Helps small fish theatre navigate the big internet ocean!,Natalie S.,Business Manageer,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Apr 27, 2015",5,5,nan,5,nan,nan,"Comments: We started using Wintix/Webtix in the fall of 2013 for our 2014 season. It has jumped us into the 21st century by allowing us to offer online ticket sales! Wintix has enabled us to streamline the way we store all of our box office information and has eliminated the need for other software programs that we had been using to track our sales (Quicken, primarily), keep customer records and print tickets. We have been able to customize the program to our unique situation of selling flex season passes where passholders then reserve seats for each performance individually. We have a small house of 166 seats, but this software has made our job so much easier and less time consuming in handling tickets, payments, reservations, etc. The tech support is wonderful and has been so beneficial to a box office manager that is just tech savvy enough to by... yet has been able to make the switch without any trouble! OK, well I've made a couple of panicked phone calls, ha, ha. Ultimately, the online sales capability is taking a lot of pressure off of our box office and our patrons are making the switch to find it very convenient. We still provide limited box office hours to serve the less adventurous.","Pros: Ease of use, seamless switch over from Wintix 5 to Wintix 6 with Webtix, fantastic staff to solve issues, custom programming if necessary.

wintix / webtix,Happy with Wintix for more than ten years!,Jeffrey S.,Business Manager,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"May 06, 2015",5,5,nan,5,nan,nan,"Comments: Tacoma Musical Playhouse (Tacoma, WA) has been using Wintix for more than 10 years with complete satisfaction. We have 2500 season subscribers and 2000-2500 single ticket buyers per show. We also use it for year-long educational programs, specialty shows, fundraising events and theater tours, concessions, etc. It is highly flexible. We use it to track 100% of all cash receipts. You simply set up a show to be any category of receipts such as tuition, show deposit refunds, liquor concessions. For non-show events we use the option to not use a seating chart. It's also great for Flex Pass season subscriptions where patrons don't use a series such as 3rd Friday of each show. The team at Center Stage Software are always attentive to special requests such as report modifications etc. They provide frequent updates with new features. I highly recommend it. Happy to answer questions for anyone considering a purchase.","Pros: Ease of use, seamless switch over from Wintix 5 to Wintix 6 with Webtix, fantastic staff to solve issues, custom programming if necessary.
