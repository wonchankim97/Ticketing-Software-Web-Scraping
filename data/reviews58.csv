- Feature rich

- Good Support

- Pre-built customizable web pages.

- Price is good

- Data is in house

- Built in Volunteer management

- Lots of control over many aspects of tickets sales

- Lots of features for other aspects of venue management

- Project management

- Volunteer management

- Donations

- Passes/ GC's

- Mail Lists","Cons: - Many of the more advance features takes a lot of training.

- 64bit windows needs work to improve work flow

- Requires robust computers for good performance","Overall: We have been using Theatre Manager since 2001. The software we were using before this was little more than a ms-dos program with no mouse support. Needless to say TM was a BIG upgrade. Over the years TM has hit some major milestones. First on-line sales, followed by pick-your-own seat.","Recommendations to other buyers: Over all I can't see myself using any other software. Features vs price can't be beat. Since this software is still in active development, features and usability is constantly improving. Patients is required for learning the program, but the pay off is there in the end."
theatre manager,A ticketing system for theaters of all sizes,Jeffrey D.,Executive Director,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jan 20, 2017",5,4,4,5,5,10.0,,Pros: This software allows us to operate without outside vendors. All functions are controlled internally. The software allows for online ticketing with a very professional appearance. It eliminates the need for other related software i.e. funds development and volunteer coordination.,"Cons: - Many of the more advance features takes a lot of training.

- 64bit windows needs work to improve work flow

- Requires robust computers for good performance","Overall: We have been using TM since 2002. It was a big investment for us at that time. However, it was also one of the most affordable options and immediately improved our functionality . The TM team is great at assessing your needs and giving you what you need and not over selling you. We eventually grew and TM was able to grow with us. The system allows for one stop shopping for ticketing, funds development, facilities management and volunteer coordination. I have yet to find a function from other high priced box office systems that TM cannot provide.

TM support is friendly, knowledgable and helpful. Typically, they respond within the hour and can get you fixed up promptly. One drawback is night and weekend support is not part of the standard support package. That being said, I have only needed support a handful of times on weekends since 2002.

One of the best features of TM is the ability to sell tickets online via your website without a third party. This eliminates high ticketing fees to outside vendors. Any fees charged stays with the venue. This is a great way to fund your ticketing system investment.

Training for employees is relatively easy. A few hours of training will allow a person to process basic ticket orders. Additional functions such as donations, season subscriptions and gift certificate sales might take additional time. Typically they are learned on the job.

Some specialized functions needed to sell package tickets or other non typical functions online will require a plug in. Plug ins are paid for separately and scheduled in advance through IT.

Another great feature is the ability to provide box office services to other organizations within your community or in different spaces. TM allows for multiple venues and seating configurations and pricing options. This can also provide additional revenue streams to your organization.

Artsman is a small and well run company. You have direct access to all levels of management and ownership. They are very sensitive to your needs and feedback and often respond in very positive ways. I have made comments or suggestions that eventually make their way into a future updates. I highly recommend this company and product.","Recommendations to other buyers: Over all I can't see myself using any other software. Features vs price can't be beat. Since this software is still in active development, features and usability is constantly improving. Patients is required for learning the program, but the pay off is there in the end."
theatre manager,Biggest bang for the buck,kirsten p.,director of marketing,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 12, 2018",4,3,5,4,5,10.0,,"Pros: It's all about what you are used to, and we've used TM for over 15 years. There is nothing we've asked of TM that it cannot do, or that their developers haven't been able to make happen. Theatre software is difficult and complex, and usually not very intuitive. In that sense, this is the same! But once you learn how to do what you need to, there is not a better value out there.","Cons: Anything I've not liked over the years (mobile access, slow load times, etc) has all been corrected in future development. I've not liked that I cannot export, as a file, multiple phone numbers which is a holdover from landline days. But I expect that will be fixed shortly.","Overall: We are a regional theatre with a 900+ seat house, and multiple weeks of sales for multiple productions. We can initiate any promo, seating package or report that we need. If we don't know how to do it, the customer support team will figure it out.","Recommendations to other buyers: Over all I can't see myself using any other software. Features vs price can't be beat. Since this software is still in active development, features and usability is constantly improving. Patients is required for learning the program, but the pay off is there in the end."
theatre manager,Affordable & User-Friendly,Nicole S.,Development Director,"Fund-Raising, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jan 25, 2017",4,4,4,4,5,8.0,,Pros: It's more intuitive than other similar software that I've used.,Cons: Updating the web sales pages is less intuitive for the average person and requires html editing knowledge.,"Overall: For the price, you cannot beat Theatre Manager. I have used it at two different organizations, and it has served our needs nicely. The support team is responsive and helpful. Like most software, you get out of it what you put in. If your staff are willing to learn the system and get excited about all the ways it can help, then it's wonderful! If you have a staff who don't like to learn new things and aren't inquisitive about ""I wonder how I find this information or use this to help me do x, y, and z"", then you will not be getting your money's worth. It can do almost everything you need a CRM database to do, but you have to be willing to put the training and time in to take full advantage of its features. It's intuitive for those who are tech-savvy and see the value of multi-dimensional data (I fall into that group), but may not be valued by those who aren't quick to adapt to new technology (some of my colleagues fall into this group). I highly recommend this product for organizations that are interested in data and using technology to help them do their work better and more efficiently. Even if you use it only to sell tickets (though it does SO MUCH MORE), it is likely a step up from any third party vendors you are currently using (it definitely was for us).","Recommendations to other buyers: Over all I can't see myself using any other software. Features vs price can't be beat. Since this software is still in active development, features and usability is constantly improving. Patients is required for learning the program, but the pay off is there in the end."
theatre manager,Love my TM!,Sandy M.,Office & Ticketing Manager,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jan 20, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Everything. It integrates events, classes, donors and volunteers all in one place. Works well most of the time. Bugs happen, but they get fixed. When I see things that need attention, they're always quick to respond and implement changes as needed.","Cons: Reports are a bit overwhelming. Wish there was some sort of cheat sheet...that tells you, ""If you're looking to find out this...this report will help...""","Overall: I think Theater Manager is amazing because it's fully integrated and makes it easy to track everything. The only software that combines all four basic functions...ticketing, classes, donors and volunteers. I also love a lot of the new things they're implementing. The feature to allow patrons to set up their own payment plan online for certain classes is amazing...and was even easier than I thought it would be . The tech service is great too...they're all so fun to talk to on the phone and usually resolve the problem quickly and easily.","Recommendations to other buyers: Try it, it's fun. Easy to use..."

Friendly staff

Mainstreamed experience","Cons: Not as much integration as the other, larger ticketing softwares

Difficult to adjust if you have no knowledge in coding","Overall: A great value for what you get. End users should understand that functionality is limited versus some of the larger players, but you absolutely save money in the long run.","Recommendations to other buyers: Would love to have ""templates"" that can be created with the software when you download, i.e. - Donor Letters - Confirmation Emails - Pre/Post Show Emails So that institutions can adjust them to their own language, but have the functionality right away."

From the sales rep, tech support and even the founder - my questions are answered quickly leading to a high level of customer satisfaction. The Theatre Manager software is user friendly, with quick online help links for additional details. The box office, development and overall CRM functionality has greatly streamlined our organization's operations allowing us to devote more time to programming and promotion.",Recommendations to other buyers: Spend some time training on the new system with your entire staff to learn the software as a collective - it will be helpful in the future as questions arise.

Customer support is also a huge benefit - they are there when we need them with fast response times and friendly smart people.","Cons: Hosting internal hardware and all that goes along with it. I know there is now a cloud hosting option but its too expensive for our organization to consider at this point. The user interface feels long in the tooth as well, daily use is functional but it does not feel like I'm using software designed for 2017. Also, the email ""blast"" feature has never lived up to what was advertised. WYSIWYG is not a reality when we've tested the feature multiple times throughout the years. We still rely on MadMini for our mass communications and that means maintaining two email lists.","Overall: We've been using Theatre Manager for over 10 years and it is the backbone of our operations. There is other software out there, but not at the price and user features that Theatre Manager has. We highly recommend implementing the software with WebSales if you run a venue or have any box office needs where public ticketing is your main business.","Recommendations to other buyers: While Pacific Theatre isn't considering alternative platforms, staff recently attended a 1hr Spektrix demo and were impressed. Doubling down on engineering and development, integrating with Facebook and generally ""updating"" the look and feel of the main product will be important when considering customer retention in the next few years (in my humble opinion)."
theatre manager,Long Time User,John C.,,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jan 20, 2017",4,4,4,5,nan,nan,Comments: I've been using Theatre Manager for over ten years now and it has been a consistently reliable ticketing and venue management solution. The software is one of the best options available at a great value.

We also manage the Charlottetown Event Grounds and successfully sold Shania Twain, over 23,000 tickets in 2014 using Theatre Manager. Whether events are small or large we find Arts Man will do everything necessary to ensure smooth onsales. Our venue hosts a QJMHL team the Charlottetown Islanders, NBL team the Island Storm, along with various concerts, dances, festivals such as Jack Frost, Wine Festival, and Shellfish Festival.

theatre manager,Amazing Features with just a bit of a learning curve,Jennifer P.,,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jan 20, 2017",4,3,4,3,nan,nan,"Comments: I have used many ticketing services in my career. Some examples include Easyware Total Info, Vendini, Proclass, Win Tix, Ticketmaster and Archtics. I feel this system has the most to offer in every area that a community arts center like ours needs. It is great to track patrons in classes, volunteering, tickets and marketing. With the extensiveness of the program it is sometimes a challenge for those who are not as familiar with box office systems. The amount of steps are much greater in this system than the last system we used. Sometimes it is hard to get a prompt answer from the help desk. Other system have instant online help (Instant messaging) that helps with a faster answer and quick problem fixes.","Pros: User features, reporting and the newly redesigned web sales module is terrific.
