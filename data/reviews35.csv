raklet,Evviva Raklet!,Elisabetta M.,Professor,1001-5000 employees,Used the software for: 1-2 years,nan,Source: Capterra,"Aug 03, 2016",5,5,4,5,4,10.0,,Pros: It gives an answer to most of the administrative and other kind of needs of our Cultural No Profit Association. The founders of Raklet have been and are open to our requests and we found a very positive collaborative dialogue with them.,"Cons: At the moment

- I do not understand how I can get the complete list of all the anagraphical, fiscal and administrative data related to all members (this is our most important administrative need). For each member we need to show: Name, Second Name, Italian Fiscal Code, date of request and date of acceptance of the Association, address and email or telephon number, if he is Active or not. If we receive a Fiscal Visit we have to present easily the complete list of all these data of all our members.

- Raklet does not still allow to keep a register of Contacts of Persons that are not yet MEMBERS. Therefore we cannot envoy Newsletter to them, nor envoy promotional messages or Invites.

- The graphic possibilities of Newsletters might be potentiated.

- It might be good to let New Members of our Association to read Italianinformations about Raklet and few but clear instruction about its use.

- It might be developped the use of Raklet as Social Network of Members.

- It might be developped the use of SMS for the payment of the fees!",Overall: I am the President of a No Profit Italian Cultural Association (we perform Ancient Classical Theatre in Milano) and I can assure that a software like Raklet can give a very important help in the administration of the Association (a complex task) and in the relationships with members.,"Recommendations to other buyers: GO ON and let us to have also a complete Italian version, if possible! In Italy (but not only here) it might find a good market!"
raklet,Good option for starting your own organization,Christian A.,Secretary,"Environmental Services, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Jul 08, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Raklet is very handy if you like to have a membership management tool for your association in combination with a private social network for your members. I really like the approach to sharing new developments in the community. All functionalities are mainly focussed on customer needs and once they are developed they will be released to other organizations as well. The Raklet team is very friendly and is willing to help and assist with any adaptions and where ever possible. Their development prices are quite competitive.,"Cons: It seems to be an ongoing project where major developments can be only expected if paid for. This means that basic functionalities should be checked before a decision is made. Adaptions will cost you extra. A high number of smaller developments are risking to get a kind of ""messy code"" - Therefore, in my opinion, a basic revision of the Raklet code every now and then would be a reasonable measure.","Overall: We are using Raklet as a membership management tool in combination with the private social network. For our members, it is implemented as a membership area, where they can share their details and information about themselves as well as details about their affiliation. The details are basically our stock of data about our members. So they have to keep their details updated and we save time for other tasks. We are also using the events function of Raklet which enables us to sell tickets to our members and the public charging them different event ticket prices. That is very practical because it is automatically checked whether one is a member or not. We are also using the Email function which enables us to send automated emails on the basis of pre-designed forms. Another important function for us was the relatively new developed function of Raklet ""pages"" which enabled us to publish content within the private social network that should be seen from our members only. This was a crucial point to us because we had this area on our website first and were not willing to have a double login, one for Raklet and one for the member area on our website. Therefore, we are glad that we have had the support of the Raklet team and would recommend you to use Raklet.","Recommendations to other buyers: GO ON and let us to have also a complete Italian version, if possible!
