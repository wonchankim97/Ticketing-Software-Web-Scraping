Weemss offers an amazing experience,Jeremie M.,"Founder, organizer and curator",Entertainment,Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 07, 2018",5,4,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: The user interface is great, easy and fun to use. Every functionality is there from coupons to special offers. The website integration works great on every platform and its design is so great and up to date that it fit perfectly within our website. And the responsive functionality makes for such a better experience for our customers. Emails are great and we only had positive feedback about them. Allowing customers to print their tickets and then SCAN them (how amazing is that) once they arrive at the event. On the backend, we could had every information we needed a click away and the feedback presented as graphics gave us great insights about our customers and allowed us to learn about who they are and how to target them.

Weemss is also way cheaper than other companies who offer a weaker product they try to pass off as great when its really not.

So yes, Weemss does offer an amazing experience!","Cons: Well, nobody likes to pay a fee on each ticket, but unlike their competitors, Weemss only take a tiny portion of the profits and use it to create a better user experience for both us - organisers and such - but also the person buying the tickets.

So much that it makes us happy not only to pay less than we would to their competitor, but also to know that the money is used to offer a better experience to our customers.

Because we are based in France, we would have liked a more international experience. Some sentences feel badly translated from english to french, and that's something our customers notice.

We would have loved to be able to fully customize the printed ticket, which we were only able to remotely do.",,
