silent_auction_pro,Great Support and good for small non profit,Jennifer H.,Event Chair,"Fund-Raising, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,18-Apr-19,5,4,4,5,5,9,,"Pros: This is great software for silent auctions and generally a good value for a small non profit. They have amazing customer support with almost immediate response and the help section is fantastic. The on-line program for auction items is a tremendous feature. This gave us the opportunity to market our auction items in advance of the event and create a buzz. We love the ability to be able to pull up past donations and have the fields autofill - that saved a lot of work the second year we used the software. We also love the scheduled communications. We scheduled an e-mail 2 days prior to the event to go to all attendees with information on parking, dress, etc., as well as an e-mail 2 days after the event thanking people for attending. Lastly, we LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the e-mail/text notification for auction winners. So many people have commented on how much they appreciate this feature.","Cons: I will say there were a few quirks with ticket purchasing. We had 2 couples buy tickets and have receipts but they were not in the software anywhere. This happened last year as well. Silent Auction has yet to find out why this happened, but overall the ticketing system works well. Since this quirk happened the first year we had a ""back up"" plan if it happened to anyone this year and how we would handle it. I wish the site was more clear about security of the site and that the credit cards are going through the paypal system, not our computers. Some people get funny about buying items on-line and we have had a few of these instances/complaints. I also wish it was more clear when someone was buying multiple tickets that the first ticket was going to the buyer - and if the buyer was buying tickets for someone else they could change this in the system if they were not attending or already purchased their ticket. I wish there was a way to modify the bid sheet layout. I think the site could easily become more user friendly by creating buttons for some commonly used things - such as create a donor, create a donation - instead of links buried down in the page. So many of the links look similar and can get confusing for people that are not using the software on a regular basis.","Overall: I would love to see the other side of the database developed - the expense side. I would like to be able to run true reports revenue verses expenses. I wish Silent Auction Pro would have additional fields that could be labeled however the customer needed them - similar to creating different types of tickets but for other needs related to auction items. Lastly, I have only one complaint about the cost. I understand and accept the cost and 2% for auction items, however, it doesn't seems fair to have the charity pays 2% of the cost of a consignment item (ie. trip, autographed album cover) that cost $1000's of dollars. The charity ends up paying silent auction pro most of the profit they make on the item if they only make a couple of hundred of dollars over the consignment price. I believe the 2% should be on what the charity makes net on the auction not gross.",
silent_auction_pro,Excellent Choice,Lara K.,Executive Director,Hospital & Health Care,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,7-Oct-17,5,4,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: This is terrific software, especially for a smaller nonprofit. What sold the software to us is that when I inquired about it online on a Saturday, I got an immediate phone call from the owner of the company and software developer. This was very typical of all interaction with this company throughout our use of the software - we got immediate responses from support when we had questions, they understand that auctions happen on weekends and support needs to be available then, and when we found a few quirks in the software they were repaired immediately, often by the developer personally. We previously used Greater Giving and BidPal; all three have features that I like and don't like, but overall SilentAuctionPro is by far the best value for the price. The a la carte pricing is a huge benefit for nonprofits like ours that cannot use all features (i.e. online bidding). Overall, from last year to this year (BidPal to SilentAuctionPro), we went from about 100 to 195 attendees, and from our worst checkout ever to our best. The instruction files, help menus, videos, etc were by the far the best of any nonprofit software we have used. We were invoiced after the auction for the software, which could be of great benefit for a nonprofit just starting out with their first auction.","Cons: I would love to be able to have a website where people can enter their own donations and have them populate as donation items in the system. There were a few quirks like the system not liking quote marks and ampersands. I would like for there to be a bit more explanation on the page about the security of registering your card as many of my guests weren't comfortable doing so at the time of ticket purchase. It would also be great to have more customization options for the ticket sales page. Because of the way we run our auction, I would very much prefer to be able to assign bidder #s to a household rather than to an individual, but this would have been fine if we had noticed it earlier and planned accordingly. I would also like to be able to customize a bit more on the receipts, include ticket descriptions, etc. I would have set up our fixed price items differently than we were advised to as I don't think it was the best option for our auction and was a bit of a hiccup, but in fairness it was something we didn't get to in advance and did on the fly, so it would have been avoidable with a little planning. Although the reports are generally pretty great, I did have to piece together a few to get to what I needed which could be a pain for someone with less Excel experience. Really minor, but because we can't use online bidding, I print our bidsheets on carbonless paper. Would very much prefer that the half sheet option printed as a 2up because I ended up reformatting them in Adob","Overall: Helped us run our best auction to date, with virtually no line at checkout, even though we had almost doubled our attendees from the prior year.",
silent_auction_pro,Tremendous system for making charity auction easier to set up,Charisse B.,Committee member/volunteer,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,6-May-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Donation entry was intuitive and loved that we could pull up items donated before so that we didn't have to retype everything. Demo environment allowed us to get committee members up to speed quickly and also allowed us to practice on some creative set up to meet our auction needs. Ticketing feature offered a variety of ticket options, some only displaying with a promo code, and love the addition of the asking for the email address for a ticket purchasers' guests - made it simple to reach all attendees with the marketing tools. Allowing the ticket purchasers to select the meal, or any other item we programmed made the table/catering coordination easy. Marketing features to promote the event to our attendees as well as help them feel connected to the event that was a couple months away. We set up an online auction the week before our event and people loved it! The online auction was open to the public so it allowed parents to share with friends and family that weren't planning on attending. We posted the event auction items on the online auction as previews to entice bidders to attend to get a chance at the rest of the silent and live items. Reporting is good, check in/out is all on one page, the system performance is great. Loved working in system even from our smart phone browser to check on things, make changes etc. any time, any where. Customer support was outstanding!","Cons: Special characters aren't allowed in donation title so we had to change once they got loaded as an auction item. Special characters in the description like "" for inch threw off the formatting of the data export to excel. Reporting is good, but would have liked a few more reports or the ability to create ad hoc reports. We found one report provided this item, but another report provided this item so we had to export to excel and do look up functions which is tedious to do each time. Would like more options for formatting of bid sheets, and also would like to see some additional options with displaying, leveraging the ""Donation Tag"" feature which is critical for us as our teams need to be identified. Would like filters on lists as well.",Overall: Set up and run the event solely from volunteer committee without having to contract with other services for ticketing or check in/out. Handle high volume auction and attendee counts with smaller committee.,
silent_auction_pro,Silent Auction Pro helped us manage over 400 auction items at our event.,AMY A.,Secretary,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,15-Apr-17,4,4,4,5,3,9,,"Pros: Silent Auction Pro allows us to manage a high volume of donators, donations, auction items, bidders, etc. Customer support is great, they are always available to answer my questions timely. Loved the phone call the day before the event to share the 800 number. Love that we can email receipts to winners. Love that we can notify winners via email or text once a table is processed. Like that you can have multiple users at same time, especially at event day, doing data input, checking in bidders, checking out winners.","Cons: 1) Certain characters are not liked by the program (inch symbol, & symbol), especially when exporting to excel. 2) Bid sheet area to write in bids is too crowded, would like options to modify bid sheet layout, not sure if we can or not but would like opportunity to export bid sheets to a file and add ""NO BIDS"" on back side of page 3) Price went up from last year, both module cost and %. 4) Would like more options to print vs export and when exporting to design what fields and sort order, especially on sold items 5) Dont like that when you create duplicate items that they are linked and then if one is not sold it cannot be deleted without deleting them both 6) When you update an auction item, you go back to the donation, update, then update auction item. It does not always take the updated title from the donation as the new title of the auction item. Cannot figure out why. 7) would like the name on the bid sheets to be larger font, as we had two bidders get the wrong cards and not know that it was not their name at the top 8) Would like bidders to write more clearly :) (I know, out our your control) 9) Would like a quicker way to see what auction items have no bids at the end of the event instead of scrolling through the page","Overall: Silent Auction Pro allows us to manage a high volume of donators, donations, auction items, bidders, etc. Customer support is great, they are always available to answer my questions timely.

silent_auction_pro,"Silent Auction Pro - Good, but with some significant reservations",Alan H.,Gateway Gala chair,"Entertainment, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,9-Nov-16,4,2,3,5,3,7,,"Pros: Capturing information about donors and donationsCreating auction items from donationsChecking guests in and out, and providing them with invoicesBid entry (except for Fund-a-need)","Cons: Handling reservations and guests, especially couples and other groupsFormatting bid sheets - very little control over this formatHandling creation and bid entry for fund-a-needRequirement to create a merchant account with Vantiv","Overall: Southern Gateway Chorus used Silent Auction Pro (SAP) to manage our Gateway Gala for 2016, our major fund-raiser of the year. We found much to like about it, but also a few things that could stand improvement.",Recommendations to other buyers: Be sure to train all the people who will be involved on the day of your event.
silent_auction_pro,Silent Auction Pro Thought of Everything!,Stephanie D.,Volunteer Event Chair,,,NO,Source: Capterra,10-May-16,5,5,3,5,3,7,"Comments: Overall, I am extremely pleased with this software. I was totally immersed in it, learning every possible feature and application, to ensure that we got the maximum use.Pro's:1. The Help section is extremely well documented, and the customer support is amazing. The You Tube videos were very helpful for training both me and my volunteers. Any time of the day or night when I sent an email, I had an immediate response.2. The options available were extremely comprehensive and knowledgeable about the mechanics of a benefit fundraiser. I cannot think of anything that I wanted to do that I couldn't do. From donor setup, to bidding styles (purchase of ticket parties for Teacher Experiences, to Silent Auction bidding, setting different minimum bids etc) to performance tracking, exporting info, everything was there.3. The buzz that we created with the auction was definitely a boost to our event. We doubled our attendance vs. last year, just by starting the auction 4 weeks before the event, and creating excitement about the items that we offered early.4. I am now set up for next year, with over 50% of the input work established already (donors, pictures and logos, bidders, etc). Next year should be a lot easier!5. Auction Day section is powerful and easy to use - The check in was easy, online bidding was easy, and checkout was VERY easy, especially for those who had already registered their credit cards online. I could just click ""auto process"" for a batch of auction items, and with a click of the button, 20 people were checked out at once. Then I just looked up the auction number, passed out the gift envelopes or baskets, and done!",,,,
silent_auction_pro,A Software that DEFINITELY Helps you Raise More Money,Cindy J.,Executive Director,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,24-Mar-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: This was our first use of this software and we were very satisfied with the results we achieved the night of our event. The software is relatively easy to use - the modules are marked but you do need to take you time to make sure you are on the right page. The customer support was fantastic. Every time I had a problem or a question they were there to answer it. They were able to go into my site, analyze my problem and help me solve it.",Cons: The modules could be designed to be easier to differentiate.,"Overall: This was our first use of this software and we were very satisfied with the results we achieved the night of our event.

silent_auction_pro,"Saved Us Time, Trouble And Confusion!",Celia A.,Volunteer,"Education Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,17-Jun-16,5,5,5,4,5,10,,"Pros: You can enter your donations one time and duplicate them if you have more than one or if you are repeating the same items the next year, you can see where your volunteers are in the process of getting their donations and they can mark their status, you can bundle lower value items together to make a larger basket and it is easy to do, the check in and check out at our event was fast! And, I was able to enjoy the actual event for the first time.","Cons: Not really a con, but a suggestion if you use this software: have a designated person in charge of using the software and train everyone to enter the information consistently. I think their best practices was helpful'it saves time to make sure you take that step so you don't have to edit a bunch of things later.","Overall: Before finding Silent Auction Pro, we were doing everything by hand. It took up a lot of everyone's time and led to a lot of frustration. After a very stressful night of having people waiting for us to hand calculate their winning bids and asking us every five minutes if we were ready, we decided there must be a better way to do this. A fundraiser should be fun! It has fun in the name! So I found Silent Auction Pro. It made such a difference to not have all of those people waiting for us to give them their winning items and invoices. And, checking out was quick. I highly recommend for events like silent auctions.","Recommendations to other buyers: This was a learning curve piece that I will share: sell tickets through silent auction pro'there isn't a charge to do it (we had already printed postcards and were selling tickets at the school so I didn't think about it the first time). If you sell the tickets using silent auction pro, all of the info is stored so you don't have to enter it later and it is much easier to track everything and the ticket purchasers don't even have to check in."
silent_auction_pro,Auction software - JUST PERFECT FOR US!,Emily D.,Finance Officer & Volunteer Extraordinaire,"Financial Services, 5001-10,000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,20-Dec-16,5,5,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: Add donor, add donation item, save! The extras are great:logos & pictures for displays, the communication tool saved us & we were able to message our bidders with auction highlights.","Cons: After our 2nd event, the system usage seemed more intuitive. We didn't realize how many features we could have used that first time! Would love the system to accept AmEx, not just Visa/MasterCard.","Overall: Three years ago was the first time we used SilentAuctionPro. And we used it again for this year's event. SAP handled our 450+ donations with five users, 200 auction items, online bidding by 225+ guests and the raffle ticket feature.",
silent_auction_pro,Silent Auction Pro is the BEST value available with amazing customer support!,Amy J.,Nonprofit Consultant,"Non-Profit Organization Management, Self-employed",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,19-Oct-16,5,4,4,5,5,10,,Pros: It is intuitive and and easy to learn. Support team is very responsive and is constantly updating the product. It offers the absolute BEST value of any auction software I have used or researched! The mobile product is clean and user-friendly.,"Cons: Some of the functions are a bit hard to find. You do have to be a self-starter to research all of the functions and know exactly what is needed before the gala night to check in, check out, and close the auctions. I had to contact customer support several times throughout the evening for assistance.","Overall: As a nonprofit consultant, I have worked with a variety of nonprofit organizations on their gala auctions. I recommended Silent Auction Pro to a nonprofit pre-school for their gala. We utilized all of the features offered by SAP, including a live and silent auction, the mobile feature and the event planning features with a very user friendly table assignment function. The product is very responsive and intuitive, and helped this organization raise over $79,000 above sponsorships and ticket sales the night of the gala!","Recommendations to other buyers: Start very early to learn the product and do all of the research. Work in their Sandbox demo and do a mock event training with committee members well before the event. Make sure you have plenty of people to do different functions - a separate cashier at check-in and throughout the event. Several committee members are needed to procure, enter auction donations and help package them. Another committee should be responsible for reservations, seating, and check-in."
silent_auction_pro,Sheboygan Service Club,Heather C.,Foundation Treasurer,Fund-Raising,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,30-Nov-16,4,4,4,5,4,8,,"Pros: Silent Auction Pro helped our auction and operations team see data (auction items, ticket purchases) on a real-time basis. Previously, we relied on spreadsheets and emails, and version were easily confused and confusing. It was also great to tally up totals at the end of the evening quickly to make a grand total announce while all guests were present.","Cons: This was our organization's first time using mobile bidding and it was received with mixed reviews. It was confusing for some to login if they didn't receive an email. We will collect emails at registration next year to make it smoother. The QR codes on the items were great, but most guests did not already have the app on their phones. It was difficult, at times, to scroll through items. Lastly, it would be great to have a cross reference for ""baskets"" by individual. We weren't sure why the numbers continued from 2015 rather than starting fresh for the new event.","Overall: Silent Auction Pro is a powerful tool for fundraising events. Login is smooth for past members and new members of the organization. Once you're on the site for some time, it's neat to see all the various ways data can be sorted and viewed. Mobile bidding was an interesting transition for our group and guests, but I think it will become smoother every year. The software has made tasks for the auction and operations team smoother every year with the saved data. It was great to see our member's work real-time, so we knew where we were at for auction items and ticket sales. It's also great to have the data saved in one spot from year to year.","Recommendations to other buyers: If you group will be going with the mobile bidding, try to post items in advance and have folks sign-up to the site in advance. If this happens, guests will spend less time at the event looking at their phone and trying to figure it out."
silent_auction_pro,We have used Silent Auction Pro for the past three years to manage our school auction.,Heidi H.,PTA president,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,15-Apr-18,5,4,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: The biggest pro for our organization is the customer support. It's superb. Being a rotating group of volunteers, we don't always have the technical know-how to manage the software right out of the gate each year, but the team at SAP really helps get us there by being available, knowledgeable, and clear with their guidance. Other pros: the functionality is robust, allowing us to do everything we need (set up online, silent, and live components of our auction, plus sell raffle tickets and track a fund-a-need). The platform is well organized and easy to navigate.","Cons: It does take some time up-front to learn the software and all that it can do. Sometimes we worried that we weren't using it at its full capacity or were taking more steps than necessary to complete a task. However, I think this is particular to our situation, because our group changes every year.",,
silent_auction_pro,Windsor Farm Elementary PTO Silent Auction Pro Review,Lisa S.,Volunteer Coordinator /Board Member,Philanthropy,Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,27-Mar-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Easy to use, great customer service, able to manage all needs in one platform.",Cons: n/a,"Overall: Silent Auction Pro provided an ease and professional quality to our annual auction we had not previously enjoyed. In years past, our annual elementary PTO Fundraiser and Silent Auction was a tedious process. We would create our Bid Sheets and Display Sheets on separate programs. We would have another person create our event programs. Our donations would be logged in an Excel Spreadsheet. We would have ticket sales go through the office secretary. It wasn't seamless and it wasn't efficient. The checkout process at the event was also a mess as we didn't pre aucthorize credit cards and would have weeks of clean up trying to collect money from bidders who left without paying.",
silent_auction_pro,"Great auction software, outstanding customer support",Kate L.,Event Co-Chair,"Primary/Secondary Education, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,14-May-19,5,4,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: I had seen this software used as a guest at another event and sitting at our table, the excitement around driving the bids higher was impressive. So when it came for me to organize an event, I pushed for using Silent Auction Pro mobile bidding though we were uncertain that our clientele would be receptive. Post the event, the response was almost all positive, they loved bidding on their mobile devices and we made much more money from our silent auction. We particularly loved the automated winner text notification and giving them the opportunity to self check-out/pay, making it all so much faster and easier. From the point of view of the auction administrator, it made my life much easier with no last minute pulling an all nighter to produce bidding sheets, etc. The customer service was superb and personalized. Someone always answered my calls, no matter the hour and helped resolve the issue(s) I was having or if they couldn't, they referred it to the developer who is the owner and soon afterwards all was resolved. I loved the reminders ahead of the event to ensure all was moving along smoothly and the personal calls to check in were very much appreciated. I felt fully supported at every step.",Cons: It was definitely challenging learning a new system but it was worth the time and effort. There were a few little quirks that need resolving and these I have shared with the developer.,Overall: I would definitely recommend using this software to others and will use again myself. There is no doubt that we brought in more money using Silent Auction Pro. Pay attention to detail on the front side and the event will run seamlessly.,
silent_auction_pro,Great product,Jennifer M.,,"Education Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,2-Jul-16,5,5,4,5,5,9,,"Pros: We used this software to transition from using Excel worksheets (SO time consuming) to check people out from a live auction, to swiping credit cards and capturing their info for faster checkout. We were able to track our history of donors and popular items, and streamlined our request process to focus on what bidders really wanted. Selling tickets to the event became a much easier process as well. The software was intuitive, and the customer service was great.","Cons: While we loved our experience with Silent Auction Pro, we eventually felt we needed to switch companies to a platform that allowed for public searches of online auctions, rather than requiring a link and approval from an Auction Chairperson. We switched to another company in order to take advantage of a large and searchable/public auction community. However, that switch has cost us much more money. Instead, a strong marketing campaign on social media would bring the extra bidders without paying the more expensive subscription fee that the other company charged us. I will encourage the next Auction Chairperson to use Silent Auction Pro.",Overall: Silent Auction Pro completely changed the way we ran our annual silent and live auction. It took us out of the time-consuming task of tracking everything by Excel worksheets and allowed us to focus more on the actual fundraising.,
silent_auction_pro,Golf Tournament Auction - Great System!,Julie W.,Event Coordinator / Lead Development Coordinator,"Hospital & Health Care, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,2-Sep-16,5,5,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: Their online bidding system has opened up our golf auction to new participants that are not able to attend the day of the event. We have been able to grow our bidders and this helps grow the auction revenue! The software is easy to use and simple for the bidder to get started and follow their bids. It is also very easy to close out the auction quickly and securely. Customer Support is excellent! They helped us through many questions and quickly resolved any issues to make our process and event smooth and fun! There are great reporting features that have allowed us to follow up and track the information, items, donors and bidders for the event.",Cons: Would love them to create an app associated with the software for the mobile bidders to easily connect to the online auction.,"Overall: This is our 2nd year using Silent Auction Pro for our Online Golf Tournament Auction. It has been a great experience using their system and the support team is excellent - always a quick response and very receptive and helpful. In the past 2 years, we have more than doubled the amount we have raised through the auction!",

There are many features which make this very easy. The check-out system is pretty user friendly and works well. The support staff at SAP are great to answer questions and lead you through the process.,"Cons: The first ticket purchase by a buyer only allows for the purchasers name, and does not let you reassign the name to someone else right away - you have to go back in and readjust. It worked but is a little bit clunky.A lot of data entry. As we were using this for the second time, some bits were easier as we could pull from past donors info.The bid sheets selected the donations that were entered first, which were not always the biggest selling points when bundlingSetting up the bar tickets was a bit messy.Would be nice to be able to pull more specified reports from the program. Customize the report formats.","Overall: Once you play around with the program, it seems to be pretty user friendly. And what you do not know how to do or are having trouble with, there are lots of tutorials to lead you through the process. Plus the support staff is excellent and amazingly helpful.",

With Silent Auction Pro we were able to do more with less - money, time and effort! From data entry to bid sheets, display sheets, program production, online bidding, ticket sales, day of event support, credit card payments (through a 3rd party which was also phenomenal), check in/check out and post event reports it was truly a joy to work this product and the support team.",,Overall: We raised more money with less time and lower cost.,
silent_auction_pro,Solid auction software for an event of any size,Leslie L.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,15-Mar-17,4,3,5,5,4,7,"Comments: Silent Auction Pro was very helpful in getting and staying organized for our auction. It is a fairly complex bit of software, so the first-time user may be a little daunted by all the options, but the support staff is always (And I do mean pretty much Always) available to explain things, and to help you figure out any issues. They can log in and look at your event with you, and give you real feedback, rather than just general suggestions, which is a huge help. The video instructional resources are also much more helpful that a printed set of instructions and are available on YouTube. It gave us a way to quickly determine how much we had made and which categories of items did the best. We also got a summary of who still hadn't paid for their items.",,,,

We have a silent and live auction portion and this program works perfectly for all our needs. There are still even more cool features that if we took the time to look through a bit, we could make things run even more smoothly (i.e. notifying winners of their winning bids, creating thank you cards for afterward, etc.)",Cons: It'd be nice if we could change font size on bid sheets - we have an elderly clientele and I know the sheets might be hard to read for them.,"Overall: Silent Auction Pro is easy for anybody to ""pick up,"" which is good since the team running the auction has an almost yearly turnaround. Also, the customer support is phenomenal, if and when I do need to talk to someone about features.",
silent_auction_pro,Silent Auction Pro makes silent auction process simple and easy to use,Helna C.,President,"Hospitality, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,7-Mar-17,5,5,4,5,5,10,,Pros: Ease of use and simplicity of the process.,"Cons: Image upload is very limited to what is set in the system and color customization is not available. It will be nice if you can add more image in the registration page to at least match the event website. Data archive is very limited. You have to back-up data after each event, otherwise, it's gone. They're very good in sending reminders, however, having the data archive for future use provides convenience and assurance that at least you have a copy or your data in Silent Auction Pro.","Overall: The software is very simple and easy to use. There are features and functionality that can be improved, however, overall the whole process save you time and money. Highly recommended for fundraising events.",
silent_auction_pro,Great customer service and a useful product getting better. Takes a little getting used to.,Brian B.,Executive Director,,,NO,Source: Capterra,11-Feb-16,4,4,4,5,5,10,"Comments: We have now used Silent Auction Pro for 3 years for our nonprofit gala. We started using it because it was the most cost effective way to take people's credit cards ahead of time for a more expedited check out process. Our board still doesn't want to go totally electronic, so we use it to sell tickets, to prepare the bid sheets for silent auction items, and to run the checkout process from our paper-based silent auction.",,,,
silent_auction_pro,Intuitive System and Amazing Customer Service,Lauren T.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,22-Feb-16,5,5,4,5,5,10,"Comments: We needed software to hold an in-person auction fundraiser event with only mobile/online bidding (so not to have to deal with paper bids, entering bids, etc. After researching other companies and piloting several ""free trials"", we decided to go with Silent Auction Pro because it offered all of the tools that we needed at a price that was much less than the nearest competitor. As the Auction Administrator, I found the system to be intuitive and well-labeled. There was no searching and clicking through pages and pages to try to find what I needed. It is all presented clearly on the home screen that has a few clearly labeled tabs that will take you directly to whatever you need. The system can be tailored to your needs - we wanted only online/mobile bidding and we did not need card readers. So - we only selected what we needed and did not have to pay for any whistles and bells that weren't necessary. We were able to easily create an online catalog with photos and descriptions of each auction item, and we were able to paste the URL of the catalog onto our social media sites and into emails, therefore driving up the public interest in the event. We were able to have attendees pre-register, so when they arrived there were no long lines at the check-in table. Check-out went smoothly, too. All you have to do to process a check-out is to enter a bidder number. It generates a list of items and you simply confirm that you want to use the credit card already in the system (or cash/check if the person wants to pay in that manner). It's that simple. I received helpful emails from support staff alerting me to ""best practices"" and ""timelines"" without even asking. These emails helped to keep the auction planning on track and really identified potential trouble spots before they happened. There are tutorials/training videos built into the software, so training support staff is easy - you do not have to create your own manual or training sessions, it's done for you!",,,,
silent_auction_pro,A Stellar Experience with Silent Auction Pro!,Jennifer M.,Co-Chair,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,5-Aug-16,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: The biggest (HUGE) benefit of working with Silent Auction Pro is that they are real, actual people that pick up the phone!!!!! Every time I called for questions or help, I spoke with a handful of extremely helpful, skilled experts in the software that walked me through every step of the way. This customer service is head and shoulders above any I have ever experienced before! They went over and above my expectations!",Cons: I can honestly say I can't offer any negatives. It exceeded my expectations in every way.,"Overall: I have just recently organized my first charity auction fundraiser using Silent Auction Pro. As a complete novice, I found tremendous value in their free whitepaper full of incredibly helpful best practices for organizing auctions. We evaluated three software programs and went with Silent Auction Pro because it completely met our needs at a very reasonable price. It was available in several components we could pick and choose from to pay only for what we needed. For example, our audience wasn't ready for the online bidding capability, so we did not have to pay for that set of features. (With a younger attendee base, I would have jumped at the online component.) I found the software incredibly easy to use and got up to speed quite quickly. It was also very easy to train my auction support staff and the company offers a number of great YouTube training videos to help with that.",Recommendations to other buyers: Don't look any further. You will not find another program that delivers the value of Silent Auction Pro at the price point and level of support.
silent_auction_pro,Using SAP for silent auction for a Non-Profit group.,Verified Reviewer,Co-Chair,Utilities,Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,26-Mar-18,5,4,5,5,4,10,,Pros: Using this tool enables us to reach more people. I also like that checkout takes a lot less time and the customers like getting a receipt. The ability to print and check all the items from a donation or auction item perspective is so helpful when setting up. I also like the email feature so we can send messages to our patrons and Thank you notes to our donors. The ability to text winning bid status is fun too. Having the patrons credit card information helps make check out a breeze even if they are not present at the time of close out of the auction.,"Cons: Minor glitches with downloading to excel if you use that option. Easy to clean up though. There is a lot to learn to get going with the software but once you understand it, it is easy to use and the customer service is excellent.",Overall: Saves us so much time. Used to use excel and mail merge to create bid sheets. Then had to enter results into a shared Sheet. Checkout took a lot longer since had to search the sheet. Also never had an online presence before so this gives us access to more people.,

Our school auction has gone from completely paper based, to silent auction with software, and then to mobile bidding over the past four years. Silent Auction Pro walked us through this process, helping us through each transition. The customer support we received was phenomenal. Their staff even looked for any issues and contacted me with assistance! In addition, we price compared several other similar services, and Silent Auction Pro was very cost competitive!",,"Overall: Savings of time, money and energy! A huge increase in profit over the last several years!",

I recommend this company to anyone looking for an affordable, easy to use system. It was user-friendly for both our attendees and our check-in/check-out staff. The training and support received before the event was excellent, and (the INCLUDED) technical support staff went above and beyond the night of the event when we had a few users that had trouble with the system (which turned out to be simple password errors and nothing to do with the SAP software). We used a different software company in 2016 - it was ridiculously expensive, complicated to use and technical support was NOT included, but could be purchased for another astronomical amount. SAP had REAL people call us to touch base, they kept in contact with emails, and everything we wanted was included in this system. I will be recommending Silent Auction Pro to our next fundraising committee!",
silent_auction_pro,Seamless Elementary School Event,Tabitha W.,Instructional Designer,,,NO,Source: Capterra,11-Mar-16,4,4,5,5,5,10,Comments: Silent Auction Pro (SAP) helped us pull off a flawless event.

Some of my favorite features are the reporting, easy navigation and setup features that were used for our online ticket sales. We did not use the bid number feature but have learned from this year; we will want to use that feature next year. Silent Auction Pro makes everything so easy. However, the one thing that makes them outstanding is their customer service. Anytime I had a question, they were there and they were there with the answer I needed.","Cons: There is not a perfect software for anything, everyone knows that. There are a couple little things I would like to see differently but we will work together to come up with a solution for those items before the next event!","Overall: Benefits from this software is hands down the customer service. Silent Auction Pro is extremely professional, reliable and overall a fantastic software with a fantastic staff. The customer service is the best, especially when you talk to them several times on the day of your event. I was overly stressed about many things leading up to our event but my software was the one thing I had no worries about. I knew I could make a phone call or send an email and have a response immediately.",
silent_auction_pro,Great software for the price.,Bridget B.,Silent auction co-chair,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,11-May-17,4,3,4,5,5,10,,Pros: I like the amount of support we receive. The amount of help available is very useful. I like all of the tutorials on the admin side.,Cons: ITs not the most user friendly. There are a lot of steps between registering and bidding. I felt like you needed to make sure people were registered then make sure it hey had a cc added and then make sure you could charge that card at checkout. Seemed like a lot of steps for the users.,,

We love the online bidding via your phone at the event. Online bidding increased our revenue by 100%... it is easy to set up and even easier to use! Online registration allowed for the easiest checkout process ever! Our attendees loved the software and found it extremely easy to use, intuitive, and simple!",,"Overall: INCREASED REVENUE AND AN EXPEDITED CHECKOUT! It was priceless and we will be using from here on out! At first, the site can seem daunting, but with a great support staff and intuitive software with some key 'go to' areas to get to easily, Silent Auction Pro is essential to any live and silent auction!",

I also like that it keeps track of who donates each item and which account it goes into at the end.","Cons: Having to take each item from a D to an A number seems like too many steps. If you could just make it an A number and then have to review it, it would be less steps.",,

There are many reports that help you before, during and after your event. The support from the Silent Auction Pro team is top notch!",Cons: Some of the screens are too busy but once you get used to the software it's fine.,"Overall: I've used other silent auction software in the past. Silent Auction Pro is so much better than the other system. What makes it better?? Cost, ease of use, and most importantly support! I can't say enough about the on-going support that we receive from the Silent Auction Pro Team. We've used Silent Auction Pro for two events now, both have been a success. Each event gets better and each year we learn more functionality in the system. Silent Auction Pro continues to enhance their product. I would highly recommend Silent Auction Pro!",Recommendations to other buyers: Make sure you order enough credit card readers. If using bid sheets make sure you have a couple of good printers. You would be surprised at how many drinks were spilled on bid sheets ;).

Most all contingencies have bee thought through. Can be quickly rolled out quickly. No money need be paid out up front. Excellent customer support.,"Cons: There were a few contingencies which were not covered by the S/W or where the process was not intuitive. Part of our target audience/donor base is from an older demographic, part of which is uncomfortable with mobile phone apps and technology. We needed to develop work arounds to address these donors.","Overall: Great experience with Silent Auction Pro running a Benefit for an Outreach Program for a 200+ Year old Church. Silent Auction pro helped us to move Church fund raising approaches more fully into the 21st Century. Without Silent Auction Pro we could not have organized to stage the auction with the short time frame that we allowed ourselves. Had we organized ourselves to start the planning process earlier we could have been more successful with the ticket sales and fundraising, but in any case we exceeded our expectations.","Recommendations to other buyers: Start the planning process early. Organize and select your volunteers early enough to train volunteers and rehearse the process. However, one we have started using the S/W, repeated uses should become much easier as we move down the learning curve."

It would be nice to have a dedicated website that would provide links to ticket sales, online auctions, View live autions item and advertise our sponsors.",Overall: Simplifies the whole process of putting on an event and helps us to have more successful events.,
silent_auction_pro,Great customer service and great for the event!,Kjirstin M.,Owner,,,NO,Source: Capterra,3-Mar-16,5,5,5,5,4,9,Comments: I had a wonderful experience with silent auction pro. We had an event to go to- I made an account and purchased our tickets for the event and was assigned a bidder number for the event. I made a mistake and pressed the accept button 5 times and it charged my card 5 times! I immediately called and emailed customer service explaining my mistake. They took care of the problem right away and refunded the extra 4 charges. I received personal emails regarding the charges and how they were fixing it for me. It was great customer service! I was a bit hesitant about the online bidding process for the event. I've never been to a charity event where we didn't have to stay near the silent auction to keep an eye on our items that we wanted to ensure not getting out bid. I was unsure if it would be easy or difficult. Let me tell you- it was so easy! I logged into the website with the username and password that I set up when purchasing our tickets. My bidder number was automatic. I reviewed the auction items on the list. Walked around only once to choose which items we wanted to bid on. I bid on several items and then I was free to go to our table and enjoy the dinner and social hour without having to stalk the silent auction area! I watched my items- it notified me when I was outbid. I continued to bid on the things we really wanted. After the bidding ended it let me know which items we won and the checkout process was a piece of cake too. Press the button to buy and it charged my credit card on file. It was so simple and we really enjoyed our event. We donated to a great cause and this system made it a lot easier! Thanks so much!,,,,

I also like that we can sell event tickets through this site and the purchaser's credit card number is saved for express checkout from the auction.",Cons: The great thing about this software is that any time I find something that I don't like about it or I feel there is a way it could be improved I am able to contact them and they make improvements based on my feedback.,,

Add some functionality options for processing invoices.,"Overall: We've been using Silent Auction Pro (SAP) for 6 years now. We moved from using an Excel spreadsheet which became very hard to manage since our donations were increasing. The functionality fit us perfectly along with a price point that we could afford. For each of the 6 years, we always have question that come up and the SAP customer service always responds in a timely fashion. The use of SAP also has minimized if not eliminated the auction customer issues we encountered while using a spreadsheet to manage everything. I would highly recommend using SAP for anyone want to run a silent auction!",Recommendations to other buyers: Great customer service on a personal level. Not the big corporate culture where you have to press 10 digits just to talk to a person.

The instructions in the Help section are very thorough. When I had questions, I was able to reach someone right away, and whomever I spoke with was very helpful. An event agent called me the day before and the day of the event, to help with any last minute issues. Although the front end interface is not fancy, our guests found the site easy to use. Silent Auction Pro offered the best, most economical price structure of all the Auction Software, and I did a lengthy comparison in a spreadsheet of all the auction software out there.

There was a learning curve, but throughout the process, we found SAP very helpful and responsive to our questions.

silent_auction_pro,Excellent,Shelly C.,Co-chair Auction 2016,,,NO,Source: Capterra,15-Mar-16,4,5,4,4,5,10,"Comments: This is the first year we utilized a web-based software for our auction. Our school has had an auction for 17 years. We found the web-based platform to be very flexible and easy to use for multiple volunteers from home or any other place they have access to Internet. Silent Auction Pro was very responsive and able to help us work through many issues. There are many great functionalities that are available with the system if they are purchased.One issue we noticed was that we frequently have items at our Live auction that are high dollar and are purchased by several bidders who want to split the cost and claim as a tax deduction. The previous system we used had an option on the software known as a ""split bid"". Our data entry person would enter the numbers of the bidders who wanted to split the total cost of an item. These bids would have the same item number and each bidder would have a correct dollar amount of what they paid for the item on their tax letter. We were disappointed that Silent Auction Pro did not have this capability since our old system did. Overall, we like the real-time tracking of all the donations and income. It would be fantastic if there was one area to log expenses.",,,,
silent_auction_pro,LOVE this auction software!!,Lorretta S.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,8-Oct-15,5,5,4,5,5,10,"Comments: This software is an absolute MUST if you're running a charitable auction. It completely steam-lines our auction processes. I've used it for 3 auctions and can't imagine ever planning and executing an auction without it again. (In fact, I refuse to plan a fundraiser if I can't use the software now that I know how valuable it is.) The planning and preparation of an auction is incredibly time consuming and this Silent Auction Pro took the struggle out of the process. We significantly reduced auction check-out time with the stored credit card pre-authorization function. Not only does this help our attendees as they can securely enter their credit card numbers on-line themselves, it also helps our volunteers as we don't have to spend time entering credit card information in order to check them out. In addition, all auction purchases can be very quickly charged even if the winner is not present and each winner immediately receives an invoice via email. If there's a mistake, refunds can also be given very simply. There are so many fantastic features that I can't speak of them all here but will mention another favorite, the Auction Program feature. You can quickly and easily print Auction Programs which include all auction items titles, descriptions and auction numbers with a simple export! Amazing! Thank you Silent Auction Pro! Jim Donnell is also very responsive and helpful if there's ever a question about the product and how it can serve your auction.",,,,

It solves all aspects of planning and executing an auction relative to tracking of contacts/donors/donations. Most importantly for me personally is the level of customer service support. They are truly outstanding in getting back to you with answers to your questions. We had several volunteers who needed additional training on the software. The rep spent a lot of time training but didn't charge us for the entire time. Very appreciative of their outstanding level of customer service support.,

The close out was super quick and super easy.","Cons: What I did not care for was when needing to constantly reconcile a person in order for them to access the online bidding. I am sure it wont be that big of a deal next time, but being my first time, I felt that I was glued to my computer.","Overall: Overall, I was 100 percent satisfied. Each and every time I needed support or assistance there was always someone a phone call away. They always had an answer to my questions and were so kind and patient. The ease of the reports at the close of the auction saved me a ton of time. I would highly recommend this software.",

They are also pro-active - helping guide us in the weeks leading up to our event with reminder check lists and best practices to maximize our success.","Cons: Because the software is so rich in features and versatile, it takes a bit of patience to determine what aspects of the features we were using and which didn't apply to our specific needs.","Overall: We've now complete 2 successful silent auctions on SilentAuctionPro using their Mobile Pro for our multi-day silent auction, our members were bidding on items 24/7 and our Foundation benefits from increased proceeds over our traditional paper bid sheet auctions previously used.",

The few times that I had questions or needed assistance, the Silent Auction Pro team was quick to respond and made things much more simple than I was trying to make it. This was our first time doing an online silent auction and I feel that this was PERFECT for us! I was also very pleased with the ability to post pictures and lengthy descriptions with the items we were auctioning off. The payment process for the auction winners was wonderful! They were able to quickly pay and the reports that the system provided to us truly made delivery and follow up easy for us.","Cons: The only issue that I had was that this system seems to be set up for those who are having ""an event"" along with the silent auction. Sometimes, that made things a little confusing for me as we were only doing the online auction. A couple of little changes could be made for those who do not have events so that there are options for both types.",Overall: Absolutely wonderful!! Our sincerest thanks to the whole Silent Auction Pro team! They made this venture for painless for us. And they were quick to assist and also give helpful suggestions and tips that would make the whole process even easier and better for those bidding on our items!

Keeps history so you don't have to re-input all data from repeat donors. Easy to learn, and excellent demo site for pre-purchase experience as well as allowing your users to play in the demo area to practice before using it at the event.","Cons: Really only one thing....bidder numbers keep incrementing year after year which is needed to retain historical data. (I'm told they are working on a fix!) . Other than that, I can't think of one thing I don't like!!",Overall: Perfect! Being using it for 7 years and wouldn't do an auction without it. Allows you to do total mobile bidding or manual bid sheets. Customer support is very important to me and and his team are the BEST. Crazy good support!! Needed help on auction day which was on a Saturday night and rep. was available and fixed the problem. Updates and advancement in the software happen continuously so they are moving forward!

With a little practice, it is easy to find the tools I needed. The support from the Silent Auction Pro was immediate and always helpful. They also initiate follow-up calls to check on how we are doing. I truly enjoyed working with each of them.","Cons: My only disappointment is that we did not move ahead in our selection to Silent Auction Pro earlier in our annual process. We did not have the time to use the program to the fullest extent, You can be certain that we plan to begin now to position ourselves to use the program to its best advantage for our event next year.",Overall: The ability to track our data more easily including donations and donor history. Electronic bidding was loved by many but frustrated some of our older guests and others who were reticent to give their credit card to allow them to bid. These are only minor issues that we will anticipate and prepare ourselves to manage better next year. The benefits far outweighed the challenges.,
silent_auction_pro,Extremely user friendly for both staff and guests!,Shelly H.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,20-Mar-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,"Comments: We have never used an auction specific software for our annual gala event since it is a one time a year fundraiser. We knew we were struggling with check in and check out lines and not giving our guests the best possible experience at the event. I did some research and found Silent Auction Pro. We were able to call and get a demo the next day - we couldn't believe how user friendly the system was and how much it would cut down on the time it took us to manually create packages and create display sheets. I was also excited about how easy it would be to send a thank you to event attendees, bidders and donors the day after the event. I also had access to all sorts of reports following our gala and could quickly generate statistics from the event. This all usually takes me up to a week after the event to pull all the information. We received great feedback on the ease of use - we jumped right in and used the mobile bidding. Guests of all ages could use their smartphone or go to a kiosk in the room to quickly place bids and receive notifications if they had been outbid, leaving them more time to socialize with other guests. Customer service was awesome - we had a question during the event, we called and talked to someone right away who walked us through exactly what we needed to do. Overall we are very happy with the experience and will use Silent Auction Pro for our event again next year!",,,,
silent_auction_pro,Great software for charity auctions!!,Tony B.,Executive recruiter,"Philanthropy, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,15-Jan-18,5,4,4,5,5,9,"Comments: Overall, I am extremely pleased with this software. I was totally immersed in it, learning every possible feature and application, to ensure that we got the maximum use.","Pros: Silent Auction Pro is an all-inclusive software charity organization events or online auctions for fundraising efforts. It manages contacts, monitors donations, item bundling, integrated credit card processing, and a lot more. The full-featured Silent Auction Pro also supports mobile and online bidding. This will allow organizations to attract more bidders from all around the world and increase their profits. Not only can they raise more money for their charity work but they are also able to spread the word about their efforts and even appeal to more supporters.","Cons: Special characters are not readable in the software for donation title, so I have had to change certain titles once they get loaded into the system as an auction item. The special characters examples(for inch threw off the formatting of the data export to excel). Reporting is good but it would have liked a few more reports or the ability to create ad hoc reports.",,

Silent Auction Pro is a user friendly software and met all of the needs of our event, from acquiring donations to selling event tickets and communicating with guests to the actual auction. The end user product looks professional and our guests commented on its ease of use!","Cons: The most confusing set up was with our raffle items, but the process made sense after talking to customer support. Would like the option to sell and track raffles by bidder and not issuing actual raffle tickets.",,
silent_auction_pro,Greatest Decision I Made Yet!,Brandy R.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,6-Jan-17,5,5,5,5,5,9,"Comments: I have been running the fundraising event for years and after attending a special Gala myself recently, as I guest, I was able to see their silent auction was done digitally. It peeked my interest and I had to find out how to one day add it to my own events. I took the time to follow up afterward to find out the pricing for such a modern system but was shocked to discover they invested close to in moving their silent auction digital. I was upset to learn the cost and thought we would never be able to do such an improvement as the cost was too high for our small organization.This led me to start researching software that was currently out in the market and I came across Silent Auction Pro. The reviews were amazing and the pricing was UNBELIEVABLY affordable!!! I am very happy to say that as unbelievable as it sounded, we took a chance on the product, and it was the greatest decision I have made for our organization yet!!! Everything turned out splendid, the digital silent auction went off without a hitch and was a HUGE success. The software is very simple, extremely easy to get around, and it even had a few features to save us time and money. The customer service we received from beginning to end was unsurpassed in excellence! They have won us, our guest, and the charity we support over and I will be using them for years to come!!~Highly Recommend!",,,,

There are a ton of how to's in the help section, if you can't find what you need in that section, their customer support team is top notch.

It would be helpful to have frequently used shortcuts, placed within the software to be able to jump around quicker.",,

Everything is user friendly. There is the help menu that explains every aspect of the auction. There are even video help pages so you can watch it being done.,"Cons: There really is nothing to not like. The thank you letters are a little difficult, I was told by another staff member, but I've had no problems.","Overall: I don't know what software the previous auction administrator used, but the checkout like was horrendous and it did not seem like everything was as organized as the previous three years we've used Silent Auction Pro. The donations, were more organized and the check out was a breeze.",
silent_auction_pro,The Only Way to Go,Greg D.,Volunteer,,,NO,Source: Capterra,21-Feb-15,5,5,5,5,5,10,"Comments: We just completed our 8th auction with Silent Auction Pro and the first one using the online capability. The feedback from our attendees was very positive. We believe the only way to go now is online and paperless. We have always had outstanding support from SAP. The software lets you perform routine tasks once and automates the rest. Excellent data export capability. It makes the event enjoyable for volunteers and attendees. Between the school and church auctions we have run 8 events with Silent Auction Pro and raised over $383K. We are going to continue to use the software as it seems to get better every year and worth every penny. The software is easy to use and learn. There are huge advantages when next year's event rolls around and everyone knows what to do from the beginning and they can work from home with the web based software.The only con at the event was not related to the software but cell phone coverage. Customers of a popular cell phone carrier with an Android phone had good service but the same carrier with an iPhone was not good. It would be an idea to use wireless access points that can accommodate a sufficient number of guest accounts or rent/buy a cell phone signal booster/relay if there are any concerns about less than excellent cellphone coverage for all carriers in your area.",,,,
silent_auction_pro,SAP saves time!,Judy S.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,20-Mar-17,5,4,4,5,4,10,,"Pros: Ability to print spreadsheets to look for errors, reassure ourselves that we have everything. Checkout with SAP we can use credit cards. Ease of preparing for in person bidding, printing of bid sheets is easy. Also like the ability to change minimum bids, bid increments and buy it now values.",Cons: If you group items the spreadsheets can get a little wacky. Easy to fix but you do have to fix it.,"Overall: The best part of SAP is the time it saves for completing your auction and checking everyone out. We use the system to enter all donations and create our paper bid sheets. First we go online only, then we print everything for the final on site bidding. The spreadsheets and lists that are automatically created allow us to double check that everything we received has actually been entered and assigned numbers. It is also so helpful that it can track different accounts within the system. We are raising money for more than one troop and we need to be able to see the final numbers for each troop. SAP does this for us. The check-out is a breeze if you have already entered credit card information when people are assigned their bid numbers.",Recommendations to other buyers: Wasn't hard to learn to use.
silent_auction_pro,Couldn't ask for more!!,Meredith C.,Teacher/Auction Chair,,,NO,Source: Capterra,1-Mar-16,5,5,4,5,4,10,"Comments: I cannot say enough wonderful things about Silent Auction Pro. From their demonstration of the product prior to our deciding to work with them to the incredible technical support, Silent Auction Pro has everything covered. Any time I called them with a question, it was answered fully and politely. I never felt like I was bugging them or asking silly questions and that's an important aspect to me. The day of service was incredible. We ran into a problem we hadn't thought about prior and they answered immediately and I was able to make my bidder happy again within minutes. The mobile bidding was wonderful; it definitely keeps people engaged and the price going up when everyone gets text message alerts! I feel like I only scratched the surface of everything Silent Auction Pro has to offer. I cannot wait to use them for our event next year and make it even bigger and better. I don't know how the competitor companies get away with charging what they do. Silent Auction Pro does it all for a fraction of the price. You cannot go wrong and you will not be disappointed if you put your trust in Silent Auction Pro. Your event will definitely be a success! We tripled our profits from last year to this year and that's in large part thanks to the cost and effectiveness of Silent Auction Pro.",,,,

I've used the software now to run a first, smaller event and received great reviews both from guests and from staff using it.

In the days and weeks leading up to the event, Silent Auction Pro staff contacted me regularly to make sure that my planning was on track and I was comfortable using the software.","Cons: The only feature I am missing is the ability to import data from spreadsheets.

Every time I called with a question, I reached a competent, knowledgable person who was able to help me out quickly and efficiently. Our annual auction is the only fundraiser we do for our MOPS group and it works perfectly for our needs, plus there are even features we didn't get to, but would be beneficial as we become more and more familiar with this product, like using the text or emailing feature to notify past attendees of an upcoming auction, or donation info, or getting the hype up about what will be available.",,,,

silent_auction_pro,This was the first year using a computer based program for an event.

It was some-what easy to use and see everything. Having all information in one spot was helpful. Being able to see who had what and who won what in the end was nice. I also really liked being able to print bidder number and bidder sheets ahead of time.,"Cons: Having a computer based systems was nice however, we felt there were a few things we didnt like. We found when going from an auction page to auction item the pages didn't talk to each other and wouldn't update. I also didn't like that the bidder sheet wouldn't allow for more than one auction item to be featured. In the past, my group likes to put up every logo that is in the package and show proper representation. We needed to make our own in the end.",,

We do a golf fund raiser every year. This helps with keeping track of donations, auction items and BEST of all automate the thank you notes after the event. We trick the system and use the Table feature in assigning Golf Cart 4some assignments.",Cons: There is no shortcomings at all. When in doubt I simply go to the recordings on YouTube as referenced by the help menu,Overall: Reduced our cost while helped to only use items on the auction that brings the most money.,

Having users store credit card info in the system made check out very easy for us as well as our attendees. Having the option of attendees viewing auction items before event helped build excitement.","Cons: Many of our attendees complained that the software was a mobile website and not an app. We wished there were more info in the help section about how to give our users a better experience. For instance, turning your phone on the side will give you a better view of the auction item .",,
silent_auction_pro,Great use for our annual event!,Molly C.,Director of Community Events,"Education Management, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,14-May-19,4,4,4,5,4,8,,Pros: I love that our users can bid on items mobily during our event which has multiple facets rather than just an auction.,"Cons: We used a new function this year that was top n bid and I didn't like that it did not have the ability for users to have the option to use ""bid for me"" but that could be a piece creators could add in later",Overall: Excellent customer service and they are willing to work with you when/if you find an issue or have something that you need help with or help understanding!

They are quick to respond and very easy to work with. In addition, the videos for how to use the software are very well done and easy to understand!",Cons: There really wasn't anything that we didn't like about this software.,"Overall: Previously we have had a more create-as-we-go-along approach to each dinner auction held. We were looking for greater portability in auction coordinating. Meaning, we want to be able for someone to walk in the door and be able to understand what was done in previous auctions and be able to carry it forward with little to no difficulty. One of the best things about Silent Auction Pro is the support team and the support videos!",

silent_auction_pro,Fundraising can be FUN!,Jaime M.,Secretary/ auction chair,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,11-Nov-15,5,5,5,5,5,10,"Comments: We have been running a Charity Ball and auction for 84 years (I personally have been involved for 3 years) and this is the first time we've used software other than Excel spreadsheets. It took a lot of convincing to go this route, and we didn't go full in with the online bidding, but I hope to next year. We have 30 women all bringing in donation items, selling raffle tickets and event tickets. Silent Auction Pro made it so easy for everyone to enter their own contacts and donations. It eliminated the need for multiple emails and the potential for soliciting the same donor. Silent Auction Pro is very intuitive and had everything we needed, even including a way to do a reverse auction (they call it Fund-a-need)! Jim and Breann were always available if I had a question, and always had a solution to any problem I came across. The customer service was over the top. Our information will be stored so that next year half the work is already done. There is no question of convincing the group- we were all impressed, we had a record fundraiser with very little problems and next year we will be using mobile and online bidding. Thank you Silent Auction Pro- you made this the most FUN Fundraiser I have ever been a part of!",,,,

This tool helped us to start the silent auction early and therefore make a larger profit for our benefit. The customer service was one of the best I have ever worked with and they got back with answers to questions the same day. There were quite a few different fees included, but if doing a larger silent auction its worth the cost. The ease of use for ticket purchasing and running a silent auction was worth it. It was great that you did not have to hold a checkout for the payments and they were already set up online. I would recommend this company to everyone and will absolutely use for all the remaining silent auctions that we do in the future!",

Guests are always impressed with the ease of check in and check out.,Cons: I think it's a bit pricey. I think the usage fee is a bit high and the commission to Silent Auction Pro could be lower.

The program was everything I expected it to be and well worth the money. I didn't use the Auction Day option because of poor wifi at the venue, but I will find a way to use it next time. The customer service was absolutely amazing - I received at least 5 phone calls from SAP just to see if I needed help with anything and they even did a one-on-one training class with me for an hour when I first started using the program.

We had used another company for the last two years but were not satisfied with them. Silent Auction Pro answered every question we had, when we had it. They would stay on the phone and walk us through whatever help we needed from original set-up, to ongoing questions, to the day of the event and then after the event. They called us many times just to check in and see how we were doing. We raised double what we had the previous years and now have all of the data saved for next year.

No matter your skill level it is easy to maneuver through the system to input information and keep track of your donors.

All and all they look good, but I know this is a feature they are continuing to update and I'm excited for any updates to this. However, our event still went well and mobile bidding was easy for all our bidders to use","Overall: It is a great tool and easy to use donor management system.

We did so on the recommendation of someone who uses it for very large events. Although we started our event using a different software, next time we will use Silent Auction Pro to manage both the ticket sales, marketing, and the Silent Auction portion of our event.Some specific features that made it very helpful to us include:- Detailed tracking of each attendee. This will be crucial to us because we will have attendee information for future events related to our cause.- Great features for entering donations, and then creating Auction Items by bundling several donations together- Super streamlined process for entering bid winners, creating final invoices, notifying winners, and accepting final payments.- Absolutely top notch support. Whenever we called to clarify a procedure we were able to speak to our representative and get specific information.

Even with this, I'd use the group again.",Overall: We raised the amount of money overall on our net!,
silent_auction_pro,New to Online Auctions,Kristin E.,Director,"Education Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,21-Jun-16,5,4,5,5,5,8,,"Pros: The customer service was really great. I probably had a billion questions and their ""Help"" information and videos online answered most of them, but I had a couple of extra ones I needed support on. The team was really great, supportive and answered all of my questions. Another ""pro"" was earning extra money, going online really worked!","Cons: I wish the software was a little more intuitive, it was a bit of a learning curve for me. But honestly, I know there is so much going on behind the scenes, a software would have to read my mind for me to really understand it! I also wish we didn't have to get a merchant account. I knew I wouldn't use it and it was a lot of extra steps (and stress) for something that didn't impact my system.","Overall: We've only been hosting an Auction for our preschool for a few years, but wanted to try out the online option. Silent Auction Pro seemed like a good fit for our process so we gave them a try. Our event was more successful than in previous years, we raised 22% more than last year, which was super great. The staff at Silent Auction Pro were very helpful and very present. It was easy to get the support I needed!",

If I could change something, I would ask to assign my own bidder numbers based on the ticket sales :).","Overall: Overall experience is great! This was year 2 of using this program and I only had to make 2 phones to the company and it was for general information, no problems!",

In fact, she reached out to me more than I had to reach out to her. Whether I had a quick easy question or a BIG confusing question, I also felt more confident after talking to her.","Cons: The only drawback, and it isn't even really a drawback, is that the software can do SO much that I didn't even take advantage of. I am hoping that after learning the basics this time around, I can dig a little deeper next year and use more of the reports and functions that are available to me.",Overall: Safe & secure place to store and update contact information. Easy reports. Easy bid sheets. Streamlined check in and check out process.,

silent_auction_pro,Favorite Auction Software,Evan G.,Membership Manager,,,NO,Source: Capterra,17-Mar-16,5,5,5,5,3,10,"Comments: Greetings,I have used Silent Auction Pro for 5 years. It is truly the ideal auction software for non-profit and charity auctions. With over 200 items being donated, it becomes challenging to manage these items in Microsoft Excel - but Silent Auction Pro makes it easy to manage it all. The software manages auction donations, tickets, seating arrangements, and acknowledgements. I have used other auction software and this is by far my favorite. The credit card processing was secure, and went through Element Payment Services.",,,,

Working directly with the company made the process pretty seamless.,Cons: The real negative for us was having to enter silent auction donations and ticket sales in the same area. We feel that being able to enter these items in two separate areas would be much less confusing and make for better reporting at the end.,Overall: Silent Auction Pro's price cannot be beat and their support was exceptional. They were always available to answer questions and solve any problems. We have used them for 3 events thus far this year and are gearing up for two more in a few months. We are extremely happy with our decision to switch to Silent Auction Pro.,

It had enough flexibility to allow us to manage our unique online only use, it was fairly straightforward, and we didn't have a single bidder complaint about access. Our event went very smoothly!","Cons:The software wasn't always intuitive, so we ended up calling support a number of times.

That said, the support team was very quick to respond to our emails and calls, and very helpful.",,

silent_auction_pro,Deschutes Family Recovery: 3rd Annual Helping Hands Gala,Helen F.,,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,20-Jun-16,4,4,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: Ability to enter, track, and package donations. After event reports (which categories of donations returned the highest proceeds, accounting, etc.) offered a lot more information than we had anticipated and has proved to be one of the most valuable features for our group.","Cons: We found the table assignments feature was challenging to use. Also it would have been able to separate admission tickets from other types of tickets sold (i.e. raffle tickets) in the ticket reports. The system recommended entering couples as individuals, this also proved to create problems for us when assigning tables and during the check-in/check-out process.","Overall: After vetting a few other products similar to Silent Auction Pro, we opted to use SAP for our 3rd Annual Event. The price of SAP was considerably less than other products and the features comparable. Customer service was top notch! We had relied on spreadsheets for our prior 2 events and SAP saved an enormous amount of staff time before, during, and after the event.",
silent_auction_pro,Great software that is invaluable aid to fundraising,Rich J.,President,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,23-Feb-18,5,3,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Functionality is excellent. It has lots of features and benefits. The administration and reporting tools are also well thought out. It is clear they understand the many requirements of fundraising.Finally, their support is outstanding.","Cons: It takes a while to learn the navigation- where tools are located.

High use of Bidding and reporting. Ease of use entering donations and creating Auction items.,Cons: There was nothing that I disliked about this product except that it would need the ability to have multi winners.,"Overall: The main problem we were trying to resolve was the Check-in process and checkout process. Both were easily to resolved with Silent Auction Pro (SAP). Another common issue we had was the ability to grab more bids per auction item. We found a major increase in bidding per person with SAP. Along with this tool, we are now able to see what and who donated items as in the past we were not able to track this. Having the ability to now see the percent return on auction items which we never had before. Very easy to enter donation and auction items!",Recommendations to other buyers: Support was out of this world and the help pages were very useful!
silent_auction_pro,Excellent Program for Auction,Jenna B.,Events Director,,,NO,Source: Capterra,5-Apr-16,5,4,5,5,5,10,"Comments: I have been running fundraisers for many years now and have never run into a program as efficient as Silent Auction Pro. Once you get your bearings, practicing on their well thought demo group, it is a cinch to use! I would highly recommend new users take the time to familiarize yourself with the program by surfing around the demo group and asking many questions way before your event is well under way and donations start rolling in. By doing this, it will elevate any issues when you are in the thick of event craziness and just don't have the time to call for help. Any questions I had were answered quickly and completely. Tracking winners, auction totals and all donations is super simple and made post event wrap up a breeze. My biggest fear at any of my events is always check out and this program made it so smooth, I almost questioned if I was doing it right. I would highly recommend Silent Auction Pro to a anyone who wants to run a less chaotic event.",,,,
silent_auction_pro,Seamless Transition from Online Auction to a Paper Based Silent Auction,Kirk N.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,14-Mar-16,5,5,5,5,5,10,"Comments: Our church desired to do an online auction for 1 week followed by a dinner, paper based silent auction, and live auction. The transition from online to paper was seamless. For any of the online auction items that did not have bids we could simply printed bid sheets and put them into the silent auction. We had several multi winner items such as a Dodgeball Party that were offered in both auctions. It was easy to just print the bid sheets that already recorded the bids captured during the online auction. We also loved the fact that the multiple payments can be processed for an individual bidder and the invoice/receipt clearly captures the payment activity. During the weeks leading up to our event I had multiple questions for the technical support group. I posted my questions to support@silentauctionpro.com and always received a quick and thorough response. I think their support is top notch. We will definitely use Silent Auction Pro again next year.",,,,

I loved the bundling function that allowed us to create great auction packages for our school fundraising event. We have been hosting this event for several years and finally decided to take our auction online. Silent Auction Pro allowed us to engage a larger audience in our fundraiser. We also were able to raise more money by taking our auction online. Many auction items went for their true value, which helped us raise more money for our schools.The support staff were extremely helpful and always available to answer questions or review how we were using the tool.",Cons: There wasn't a lot that I didn't like about this software tool. One additional feature that would be nice would be the ability to email those that are attending your event (if you used the ticket purchase function) vs. all bidders.,,

When the auction was over it was easy to see the totals and to charge each customer.",,"Overall: Our school used Silent Auction Pro for our online auction and ended up saving money on costs as well as making the largest profit we ever had for an online auction. Buyers told us they liked the way the auction items were set up, and that it was easy to bid and find out whether someone outbid them.",

The search function. Generating bid sheets and reports. The ease of use.,"Cons: We issued bidder numbers. The bid sheets automatically included ""Name and Phone number"" (or maybe that's the default that can be changed?). With ""Name and Phone number"" on bid sheets, we had some bidders who were confused, but we were able to match their numbers by searching the database.","Overall: SilentAuctionPro was VERY easy to use and the customer service was AMAZING. Quick , almost immediate response, even after hours.",

silent_auction_pro,Great Value for the Money,Darcy E.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,2-Jun-16,4,4,5,5,5,10,"Comments: Some silent auction management websites gouge you on you fees and commissions, really cutting into your fundraising ability. SAP provides all the basic functionality you need to run a successful auction without over-charging you on fees. There are a lot of features to choose from but you may need to hunt around a little to understand what everything does. The videos on the website are very helpful. Customer service is personally delivered and very responsive. We've worked with SAP to run our annual auction for about 5 years now and we've been happy every time. This was our first year running the auction completely online and the check out process at the end of the night was a breeze! Bidders do need to register an account ahead of time and that was the only function that ran less than perfectly, however support was quick to respond with assistance, even during non-business hours.",,,,

Great customer support as well!",Cons: Users wanted to see the winning bid amount.,"Overall: I used SilentAuctionPro for our school's very first gala fundraiser and the experience was far above expectations. Not only was the software very user friendly, and had all the features we needed to make the most of our fundraising, the customer service is the best I've experienced. Questions were answered quickly and thoroughly, troubleshooting was done timely and support the night of the event was fantastic although not needed as much as i thought as everything went so smoothly!

silent_auction_pro,Silent Auction Pro is worth a look.,Larry S.,Camp Director,,,NO,Source: Capterra,13-May-16,5,5,5,5,5,10,"Comments: Jim and his team made then selves available throughout the process. The feedback we received from the people who were biding on our items was, ""how easy it was to use."" Our only concern was on the admin side. Because we were in such a tight window from start to finish the admin side of the program seemed a little daunting. there were a ton of different drop down menus to navigate through. the software seemed to work well and like I said before the feedback from the bidders was they liked it and it was easy to use. Recommendation is give your self a couple of weeks to get familiar with the system, also if you can preregister people for the event this works best. We had 1200 people at a concert and trying to register everyone was overwhelming. All in all the program worked as designed and we are discussing how to better use the software for our next event.",,,,

Anyone on my team can look at it at any time and it's always up to date. Which means it is also a networking tool as well.,"Cons: I wish that once my donors logo is uploaded it would follow the donor on all printed materials., including bid sheets. I also would like to be able to export addresses of both the donors and bidders without having to have Microsoft office. In addition just being able to print a list with just addresses.","Overall: Being able to network, print cation, print bid sheets, cross check bidders with how many items they buy, we sent out blasts about items for sale, eventually online ticket sales and sort items",

Since it is cloud-based, all our volunteers can work in the system at the same time and can enter information as it comes in. We use the AuctionDay feature for check-out which has sped up our process tremendously! Also, the pre-populated thank you notes created after the event save a lot of time and man-power.

It fit within our budget and majority of users (a lot of which are not tech-savvy!) had a great user experience and enjoyed the mobile bidding. The back-end (admin) functions were a bit tricky for us to learn, but the Pro staff was always there to help answer our question or assist us which cut the learning curve down significantly. In addition, the founder is heavily involved in ensuring each customer is satisfied with the software and is always looking for guidance and feedback on how the software/user-experience can be improved. This was a huge deal to us and why we will be using it a second time b/c we felt heard and important, not just another client.

We typically have around 120 to 140 items in our auction. This is the second year using Silent Auction Pro. My only regret is that we didn't learn about this product earlier. Before ... the checkout process was one gigantic zoo, people were backed up forever, and trying to manually create and add up invoices was awful (and needless to say, we had many disgruntled attendees when it was all over). With Silent Auction Pro, the checkout process has actually become the easiest part of the event now. And, the reporting features the system has, is incredibly easy to use. Plus, having the database prepopulated with names and e-mails from the previous year, made the check-in process move more swiftly than ever.

I've used much higher-priced auction software in the past and found this to have just as many features as any of those. The customer service piece of it was great. There was always someone available to answer questions over the phone. The video tutorials were very helpful in training the day of staff. It took me 5 minutes to get any volunteer into the system and to learn how to perform any of the functions. With any auction, there is time involved and no software can take that aspect away but using this software saves time in the long run by creating a lot of the materials you will need before, during and after your auction.",,,,

I found my first year's use of the software to be frustrating, as I did not have time to get truly familiar with the program before trying to use it. That said, we will use the software again next year. Know that you need to train yourself before initial use, because there are specific steps that have to be taken to funnel all the information correctly.
