accelevents,Another successful online auction with Accelevents!,Jennifer G.,Trustee,"Philanthropy, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,9-Feb-19,5,5,4,5,5,9,,"Pros: I have used the Accelevent platform to host online auctions for the past three years. We just wrapped up our 3rd online auction and the process couldn't be easier. I love how we can cut and paste auction items and descriptions from previous online auctions. This makes the set up of the new auction so smooth. All of the choices and features of settling the credit card payments are robust and straightforward. The bidder interface is intuitive and easy. We couldn't be happier. It is complex enough to solicit auction items, to set a bid price and to write the descriptions. To have the Accelvent platform so efficient to use with all of the necessary bells and whistles makes the overall experience from set up, to live auction to settlement is seamless and awesome! I love that Accelevents is constantly enhancing the site to accommodate all types of events. I love the new feature of accepting online donations. Also, the customer service is excellent. Someone is always available when I have a question! Thanks Accelevents for another successful event!",Cons: The only drawback is that I could not copy the photos from prior auctions.,,
accelevents,Bringing our silent auctions to the next level,Mark J.,Reverse Raffle Committee Chair,"Fund-Raising, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,19-Feb-19,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: I have now used this product for 2 silent auctions at our Band Parents Reverse Raffle. In the past, we would make under $1000 on our silent auctions and would have to deal with the vultures hovering around the tables. With the Accelevents silent auction, people are bidding constantly and I LOVE that my guests get a text message once they are outbid. No longer do they have to run over to the tables constantly to see if they are still the top bidder. They have it all in the palm of their hand. Also, as the primary organizer of the event for 2 years, as ""go time"" approaches, paranoia sets in and I start to second guess whether everything is set to go. This year I messaged them in the wee hours of the morning the night before the event and got an almost immediate response as well as getting some last minute questions answered just hours before the event started. I haven't had the chance to use the other portions of the product, but if they are anywhere near as good as the silent auction, I'm positive they won't disappoint! Thanks Accelevents!!!",Cons: Really have no cons to speak of. These peeps rock!,"Overall: Absolutely fantastic. In the past we have never made over $900 on our silent auction portion of our reverse raffles ... with Accelevents, the past 2 years we have raised $2900 and $1900. So well worth the money.",
accelevents,Our Accelevents online auction was great!,Staley S.,Programming & Marketing,"Civic & Social Organization, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,25-Jul-19,5,5,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: Our organization just completed an online auction as a fundraiser and we used Accelevents as our platform. Everything went very smoothly and the whole experience was a plus, plus, plus! One real benefit to Accelevents was their 24/7 online support. This was particularly helpful to me because I often worked imputing auction data at night, so any questions or small issues that surfaced after business hours could be easily addressed. The team at Accelevents was very responsive and helpful. Our bidders loved the auction site, the mobile capabilities, and found the checkout and payment process was a breeze. At the end of the auction Accelevents provided downloadable spreadsheets of the entire bidding process as well as the winning bidders and their payment details. Another win-win for us was the affordability of the Accelevents rate structure. A final benefit to using Accelevents is that we can keep our account information online so that we can use the platform over and over for future raffles, bidding or donation opportunities. I would highly recommend this service for any of your auction or online donation needs.","Cons: Sometimes when I was inputting text for an auction item the cursor popped back to the beginning of the paragraph. It was frustrating and slowed me down. However, when I reached out to the Accelevents team, they acknowledged the problem right away and confirmed they were working to fix it. This kind of a proactive response which takes ownership of the problem is very helpful, in my opinion.",Overall: Great overall experience. We hit our fundraising goals in our one week auction and our bidders really liked the online and mobile Accelevents experience.,
accelevents,Easy to use platform at an affordable price.,Vicky K.,Co-Chair Scholarship Fundraiser,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,5-Jun-19,5,5,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: The site is extremely user friendly without the need to be a technical genius. It is very clear how to set up your main page and then to add items, including names, photos, and descriptions as well as bidding information.","Cons: This was our second time using AccelEvents for our online auction. After our first auction, we made suggestions for areas that could be improved and all of those changes were implemented.","Overall: Besides the ease of use for the auction holder and bidders, there are a couple of additional benefits that you may not receive from another auction site. One of them being the CSR addresses any question or concern immediately. No matter what time or what day, any question you have will be instantly addressed. The other benefit is the cost. You will have an amazing auction site with a very affordable price tag. There are no hidden fees. You will know exactly what you will be paying to use the site.",
accelevents,A-MA-FREAKING-ZING,Delia H.,Committee Chair,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,12-Feb-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: This software is so easy to use. JUST WHEN YOU THINK you need to have this software needs a function that doesn't exist you ask CUST SUPPORT in a panic how in the world you will possibly make it work they are 5 million steps ahead of you. Not only that but within 5 seconds they reply with a warm stress free reply that reassures you that your event that you spent countless hours on is going to be the most amazing and successful event that could have possibly existed for your cause. I AM NOT A TECH SAVY PERSON! BORN IN THE MILLENNIAL GENERATION I STUCK AT COMPUTERS! but they have made it beyond easy! My second year happy to plan this even thanks to these guys!,Cons: the only thing i don't like about this software program is that they don't have the outreach that other auction softwares have that they send out technical help for the actual event to make the event smooth as possible. Even though they are there to help at every second through the site i can only imagine the absolute craziness if the top notch service was right in front of you,Overall: the amazing immediate reply with in 30 seconds of asking any question,
accelevents,Excellent online auction platform!,Kelly P.,Development and Marketing Director,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,6-Sep-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Cost , ease of use for bidders, ease of use for staff","Cons: I wish you could more easily change the order of items once uploaded (more like a number system, like a Netflix wish list), and I wish that we had the option of sending out blanket notices to our bidders (""Auction closes in 10 minutes, place your best bid now,"" or a thank you to all bidders after the fact).","Overall: We have used Accelevents for 3 events, actually encompassing 8 different online auctions. They have been great to work with and very quick to answer questions. We are a small nonprofit in a smaller market, so we appreciate their low cost, but feel their product is top shelf. Our (not tech savvy) patrons have found the platform easy to navigate, and love the addition of mobile bidding to our events. We recommend them to every who asks about our experience, and will continue to use them.",
accelevents,Greatly facilitated check-out process,Joanne A.,Constituent Relations Coordinator,"Fund-Raising, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,7-May-17,4,5,3,5,5,8,,"Pros: Software was easy to use from setting up the ticket purchases to uploading the auction items. Guests easily purchased tickets and bid on auction items. None required much help the night of our auction. I liked the ability to print out the description of all the auction items, get spreadsheets of the prizes and the winners. Tech support was invaluable both before and during the auction. The guys were just a chat away, which was important the night of our event since a few questions and issues came up where we needed help.","Cons: The software was limiting in that we sometimes have multiples of the same item. This required us to list the item numerous times rather than having the top couple of bidders win the item. Also, we had a wine pull and a fund-a-cause during the evening. Normally, we would keep track of who purchased the wine and who funded the cause and bill them at the end of the evening. With the Accelevent software, people would have to pay for the wine, fund-a-cause, and auction winnings in three separate transactions. We would have liked one simple end-of-the evening transaction/charge.","Overall: Simplified check-out process, easy access to bidders and winners, pdf file of all auction postings.",
accelevents,Great Mobile Silent Auction Platform & Quick Customer Service Responce,Summer J.,Executive Director,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,6-Sep-18,4,4,4,4,4,8,,"Pros: Faster and more efficient with the the mobile bidding app, Easy to showcase and present items with descriptive information allowing bidders to completely understand what exactly they were bidding on. Quick customer service when we had any question that needed answered, along with being understand and truly caring about help us find a solution, and not be over looked VERY AFFORDABLE!!","Cons: When in the Auction Table cannot organize items in alphabetical order, Bidder in the mobile app were getting confused when to put in there names and bid amount.",,
accelevents,Perfect Product for Non Profit,Margaret M.,Event Coordinator,"Fund-Raising, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,16-Apr-19,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Super user friendlyExcellent Customer ServiceMany 'a la carte' features for NP various needs (auction, ticketing, etc.)Only pay for what you needVery cost effective for our small NP with little money to spendPhenomenal customer serviceNo app needed for auction bidding",Cons: Wish we could group text all guests at event via software,"Overall: We hosted an event and utilized Accelevents for ticketing and managing our silent auction. Ticketing was easy to set and we could customize per our specific needs. Silent Auction set-up, execution and checkout was the easy, straight forward and user friendly. Customer service and help options were phenomenal.it's old school customer service....hard to find these days. We will use Accelevents for ALL our future needs.",
accelevents,The online/mobile auction solution I've been looking for!,Marile B.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,23-Sep-16,5,5,5,5,5,10,"Comments: I volunteer with a number of local non-profit organizations and often find myself working on silent auctions. For the past couple of years, I have looked into solutions for moving our auctions online, in order to increase visibility and participation. But most of the solutions would cost us the bulk of our fundraising. For small community organizations like PTOs, the giant platforms are just not a viable solution.",,,,
accelevents,Excellent Resource for you Fundraiser,Joshua A.,President/Dad to Brooks,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,23-Apr-19,5,5,4,5,5,9,,Pros: This software is incredibly fool-proof and is accessible via multiple devices which makes adding late arriving items a breeze.,"Cons: We have had issues in regards to the ease of operation of our guests and difficulties signing in and staying signed in. This does not fall squarely on the shoulders of Accelevents as I am sure that much of it was operator error. If this service came in the form of an easy to use phone apps, it would be hands down the best product on the market!","Overall: Accelevent's has allowed our foundation to provide a hands-on experience to our silent auction supporters. Along with this, it enables us the ability to reach supporters who were unable to make the event, which has increased our funds raised exponentially.",
accelevents,"Successful collaborative fundraiser, because of an Excellent 24/7 Support Team!",Fran R.,"Volunteer, Co-Founder, Co-Organizer,",,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,12-Aug-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: This was my first time coordinating an online Mobile Silent Art Auction collaborative fundraiser. Most of our collaborative confidence, in the possibility of a successful fundraiser, in spite of my inexperience, came from the incredible 24/7 excellent AccelEvents support team.","Cons: An animated tutorial, walking me through all the steps might have helped to both lower my awkward beginner's fear-level of being so inexperienced, and also more rapidly increased my ability level. This might have helped me to reduce the number of questions I asked the awesome AccelEvents team, even though their team would still be needed.","Overall: Our collaborative fundraiser raised moneyfor each of 8 collaborators, with additional funds generated from offline purchases of paintings after the auction was over.",
accelevents,Great prorgam!,Verified Reviewer,"Volunteer, Co-Founder, Co-Organizer,","Philanthropy, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,28-Mar-19,5,5,4,5,5,10,,Pros: Easy to use on both the front- and back-end; Low cost but great value; Fantastic customer service,Cons: Some limited options with customization and graphics,"Overall: The non-profit organization where I work has used AccelEvents for a variety of events and purposes, including silent auctions, drawings, and text-to-give for small and large events. The most absolutely consistent factor has been the customer service - they are awesome! They are always quick to reply and generally are able to help me find an easy solution. In terms of the program, it is easy to use and we have had interns and volunteers trained and using the program within minutes at our events. The look is clean and smooth, and the back-end interface is relatively intuitive and straight-forward. The cost is also perfect, especially for a small non-profit with a limited budget, as the low flat fee allows us to know our costs up-front and keep the majority of what we raise to put toward our mission. We've tried a few other programs but you cannot beat the value for this product.",
accelevents,Perfect for Small/Mid Size Auction,Jahnavi B.,PTA Volunteer,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,26-Jan-19,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: This software is so easy to use--very intuitive, not too many features, but it has the right ones. Customer support is great--in chat or email with quick simple responses! Low cost--we raised $8000 and were able to keep most of it last year. Integration for payment was awesome!",Cons: We have multiple items in our auction that are the same (parking spots)--would be nice to list it on time and give the 3 spots to the 3 highest bidders. Small feature that's definitely not critical -- but a nice add on.,"Overall: We are an elementary school PTA that has a silent auction with 100 items once a year. Accelevents was perfect for us! The 1st time I used it was the 1st time we put the auction online--raising 33% more funds than in previous ""bid on paper"" years. Thank you for making our auction a big success!",
accelevents,Wonderful platform to make execution of your event easier.,Heather J.,Co-President,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,6-Sep-18,5,5,4,5,5,10,,Pros: It was very easy for multiple users to input and organize the information. The Dashboard provides a complete snapshot of where you are with planning the event. It has straightforward step by step instructions throughout the planning process and during the event itself.,"Cons: I would like to see them add a function where you can send messages to the users during the event to remind them to update their bids, etc.","Overall: We have used Accelevents for our past two PTO Silent Auctions. Whenever we had a question, customer service responded to us very quickly with answers that solved our problems. It was very affordable and easy to use from the beginning. The information stored from the first year, made planning and executing the event the next year even easier!",
accelevents,Customer Support Makes Accelevents a Standout,Janis N.,Administrative Coordinator,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,16-Apr-19,4,4,4,5,5,8,,"Pros: Whenever I had a question or problem, I could type it to CSR and get an answer within a few minutes. I was able to make a nice looking event webpage. The cost was extremely reasonable. Accelevents is located in the Greater Boston area.","Cons: We had early bird ticket prices and later ticket prices, and I put the dates in, but it didn't switch over automatically; there was something I was supposed to do manually and didn't realize it. There were sample online auction items that never went away; only the users, not the visitors, could see them, but they were confusing and annoying. The limit to the number of contacts was too low.","Overall: We used Accelevents to create our Spring Bash webpage, which included an online auction. Accelevents is pretty easy to use, but it does have some confusing parts. Customer support makes Accelevents a standout. Whenever I had a question or problem, I could type it to CSR get an answer within a few minutes.",
accelevents,Camp Cho-Yeh Online Auction Review,Rachel D.,Executive Assistanct,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,16-Apr-19,5,4,4,5,5,9,,Pros: I particulary liked it being an online platform which allowed me to work from anywhere and any computer.,"Cons: There was some weird glitch while entering item descriptions that it would let me type a few letters and then refresh and what I had typed wasn't there anymore. We had the same the glitch the previous year. Customer service told me to hit the refresh button which did seem to work a bit before it would glitch again, in which case I would just hit refresh again. I didn't make entering the infomation difficult it just prolonged the process.",Overall: My favorite thing about AccelEvents is their customer service!! If I live chatted I knew I would get a response within 2-3 minutes.,
accelevents,Great Software for our Needs,Kelly J.,Chairperson,"Accounting, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,20-Apr-19,5,4,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: I like that it's easy to use and keeps all of the details for our reunion in one place. In years past, we had to keep a spreadsheet of number of ticket sales, guests names etc. now everything is right there in one place. No checks to cash. Money transferred right to our account. This is saving us hours of work.",Cons: Not so thrilled with the initial look of the main page when our purchasers log on,Overall: I have had nothing but great experiences with Accelevents. I logged on one night around 10 PM and was having problems changing something. I chatted through the on line help and they continued to try to help me resolve my issue. ( I am sure it was more user error than software). The gentleman I was working with told me he would personally adjust what I was trying to do by the next evening. Sure enough the next day my changes were made.,
accelevents,Awesome Team! Great work!,Pooja T.,Advanced Applications Engineer,,,NO,Source: Capterra,15-Oct-15,4,5,5,5,5,10,Comments: We used both Auction and Raffle feature of Accelevents for Altera's Annual Fundraiser Golf Tournament. Jonathan and Zach have been very supportive and very prompt in answering our question. We really appreciate extended support during and after the event.,,,,
accelevents,Great platform to support our fundraising event,Kent G.,Treasurer,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,3-Apr-18,4,5,4,5,5,9,,"Pros: The Accel Events platform was exactly what we needed to support out 2 school fundraiser. We were able to have all of the functionality we wanted and the cost can't be beat. Also, the customer support was outstanding. We work with a number of vendors and haven't had such prompt response from support in terms of time to an answer from any ther vendor.","Cons: The only cons that we experiences were not having all of the reporting bells and whistles available to us online. All of our data was easy to download and get to the info, but it would have been nice to have some more flexible reporting. That said, this was not a huge deal and only a want not as much a need.",Overall: We increased our fundraising by approximately 20% year over year.,
accelevents,Undisputed: The Best!,Adam A.,President,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,12-Jan-19,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: We put on an annual black tie for over 300 guests. About five years ago we decided to go mobile with our silent auction and researched every provider available. Accelevents was hands down the most competitively priced but after our first year, it was clear to us that more importantly, their platform is the best out there! We've been using Accelevents loyally since day one, and couldn't be happier with the service, pricing, and most importantly the product, which our guests also love!",Cons: We are completely satisfied with the product.,,

This was the first time our organization moved it online and it could not have been easier!! The set up was simple and easy to comprehend, and customer service was superb! I could message them at any time and they would typically answer within minutes -- even the day of our event! I also liked how you can pick and choose which features you want to use.","Cons: My only suggestions would be:1.) I had difficulty printing some of your how-to articles. I would suggest making them available in PDF version so they are easier to print. When I reached out for help, I received the response ""they're made for online reading only""2.) I had difficulty uploading a photo for the banner on our event page. I would suggest looking into this.",,
accelevents,"We use Accelevents for our annual meetings, silent auction and online raffles",Fred D.,Treasurer,"Non-Profit Organization Management, Self-employed",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,1-Jan-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: First and foremost - outstanding customer service. I've been able to reach Jon and Zach at all hours and they've been exceptionally responsive.,"Cons: The products are more designed for traditional onsite fund raising events, a mold we don't fit into. However, Jon and Zach have been very helpful in tweak their software to meet our unique needs.",Overall: I highly recommend Accelevents.,
accelevents,Great software for fundraising,Nicholas N.,NA,"Education Management, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,9-Nov-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Easy to use, intuitive interface with strong features",Cons: Honestly do not have a CON. Perhaps the only thing to improve would to be add a few HOW TO videos to the website for quickly getting users up to speed on all of the features.,"Overall: Still the best software I've seen. Very easy to use to run auction event. And the customer service stands out. The team responded to every question quickly, many times within minutes of asking. The support was especially critical night of the event as we had an issue due to user error and the Accelevents team was able to help us resolve.",

We were so happy with the platform and the people behind it that we will use again, and will recommend to others.","Overall: We were able to raise an additional amount for our annual event, while the cost of the service was less. It was absolutely the most affordable, easiest and most enjoyable way to raise funds for student scholarships, travel fellowships and teacher grants. Our organization supports all students, but especially those with little or no means to access travel opportunities or to pay for college. Accel Events will be our go-to platform for our silent auction in the future.",

accelevents,Great value proposition,Verified Reviewer,Executive Director,"Internet, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,26-Nov-18,4,5,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: We looked at several auction systems for an annual charity auction to move it from a physical auction to a fully online auction. After looking at about 5-6 competitors, Accelevents seemed to be the most reasonably priced and easy to use software. A lot of other systems require a monthly subscription which is not reasonable for small organizations.","Cons: Some of the features are not completely obvious, and maybe the help articles could be a little more developed, but help was always available, prompt and patient.","Overall: Instead of cancelling a time consuming, expensive in-person auction, we moved to an online solution and saw a greater profit, with less work and less expenses.",

Easy to include images, easy to process payments, easy to edit and update. Overall user-friendly.","Cons: Their sales/customer reps are obnoxious!

After reaching out to a number of companies we managed to find Accelevents. Jon and Zach were accommodating, open to ideas, extremely responsive and customised the system to South African currency. It is also a cost-effective solution. Our online auction netted more than 34% extra revenue compared to the previous year's paper-based auction. The company has a bright future.",Recommendations to other buyers: Speak to the people from Accelevents - they are open to suggestions and have helped us customise the solution for our country.
accelevents,"Attendee of a charity event with over 800 guests, using Accelevent's raffle services",Deanna E.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,12-Aug-15,5,5,4,5,5,10,"Comments: I was (happily) surprised when I wasn't handed a long strand of tickets to fill out when I visited the raffle tables at the fundraising event I attended to benefit the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Instead I was simply asked to provide my credit card info and directed to send a text submitting my 'tickets' I had just purchased to the items I wished to win. The whole process was quick, simple, and fun! Throughout the night I kept a close eye on the live tracker on the projection screen to see what items were getting the least amount of submissions. I could strategically submit my tickets from anywhere in the venue :) (rather than a packed raffle table with a line of other guests...). I ended up purchasing more tickets than I originally intended because there were no lines to wait in or tickets to fill out - and plus it was all for charity! I would definitely attend another event using AccelEvents and plan on proposing to the committees I sit on for future fundraising events.",,,,
accelevents,Second time we've used Accelevents for our annual on-line auction. Extremely pleased.,Stu L.,vice-president,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,5-Jun-18,5,4,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Appreciate the template for downloading auction items from a spreadsheet.Event view is clear and easily distinguished between the opening and current bid.On-line support was near instantaneous.Will definitely continue to use in the future.","Cons: I wish Item Code could include numbers as well as letters, to make it easier to record multiple submissions from individual artists.",,
accelevents,AccelEvents was very easy to use both for us and the people bidding. Very happy with the experience!,Laura T.,Director of Development & Marketing,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,8-Mar-18,5,5,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: Whenever we had a question, it was answered right away. Everything was straightforward and self-explanatory.","Cons: It was a little frustrating that there were character limits when you download the catalog but not the item sheet, so in order to do everything we had to put in all of the short catalog descriptions, download that, and then delete the short put in the long descriptions for the sheets. It would've been helpful to have two text boxes, one for item sheet and one for catalog so that we didn't have to go back and forward. Also, there was no notice of these character limits so we didn't figure it out until we asked about. Clearer descriptions and additional text boxes would really help expedite the process.",,
accelevents,Great! Accel Events is very responsive and helpful. Customer service will keep up coming back!,Rachel D.,Executive Assistant,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,18-Apr-18,5,5,4,5,5,10,,Pros: Customer Service is my favorite! Second would be the ease of bidders signing up and collecting their payments.,"Cons: We sell several expierences in our auction and last year we used the ticketing option which wasn't great for us so this year we put the expierences in the auction part, worked ok but still trying to figure out the best option for our expierences.",,
accelevents,Excellent product with amazing support,Leo G.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,24-Apr-17,5,5,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: ease of use, price",Cons: wont send images or image links via sms of auction items,"Overall: We used accelevents for our silent auction and only utilized the SMS component. The system was extremely easy to use and we did not have any technical glitches. Our event was over 3 days and we needed a fair bidding system for everyone who attended. Accelerants was able to deliver and our offline (in between event days) bidding was 3x higher than during the events. It really helped boost sales. The developers are great guys and always responsive to any request or question we had, patiently walking us through steps whenever we needed guidance. I've already recommended them to several other organizations.","Recommendations to other buyers: I looked around for a long time, they are a great company. Looking forward to using their ticketing component at our next event."
accelevents,Golf Tournament,Stephanie R.,Director of Marketing & Development,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,11-Sep-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: The ease of entering my items using a csv file instead of entering each item individually and the price!,"Cons: I personally had an issue at my event where the url did not work. It was partially user error asI was in the middle of an event and the last thing I thought to do was call a customer service line, sit on hold for 20 minutes, and MAYBE get an answer. HOWEVER: The next day I sent a message to the chat service and CSR personally called me within about 1 minute of my chat request for a phone call. I have never experienced customer service like this. Now knowing the high level of customer service, I very well could have contacted him during my event and fixed my problem. Thank you Accelevents, and now I know!","Overall: This is a wonderful platform, very well designed, and exceptional for the price. The customer service is also top notch.",
accelevents,Glad I Found This Website,Laurie M.,Fundraising Chair,"Religious Institutions, 1-10 employees",Review is based on a free trial,NO,Source: Capterra,7-Oct-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: I used Accelevents for our recent raffle fundraiser. Using their program is a fantastic alternative to asking your members to sell door to door, or to take raffle tickets with them to meetings, appointments and work. Everything is done electronically, so there is no counting or record-keeping on your part. CSR's seemed to be available 24/7 to answer questions. I am looking forward to using Accelevents for our Silent Auction in the spring.","Cons: Some of the stuff was a learning curve for me, but the Chat option is very helpful, and when I look back, it was actually very intuitive.",,
accelevents,WOW...this is awesome!,Amy C.,Founder,,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,28-Aug-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: I really like the 24/7 support. When running an auction it's nice to know that the guys are there to help you out whenever needed. I also like how cheap it is. Instead of spending thousands, I spent a certain amount to make my auction successful and fund needed. That is a steal!!!","Cons: I think that they need to add a live auction feature to the platform, but they said they are working on it.",,
accelevents,Worked pretty well!,Ariane W.,event manager,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Review is based on a free trial,NGC,Source: Capterra,22-Jul-19,5,4,4,5,5,8,,Pros: I've used the text to give feature. Designing the set up was easy and quick. The dashboard was easy to use and intuitive. The analytics were helpful. Easy breezy.,"Cons: I wish the payment part has a camera to scan feature. Inputing the credit card info at an event might discourage people to not participate, as it take a while. I do like the new venmo payment feature though.",,
accelevents,Great Product!,Andrew A.,Renal Inpatient Care Manager,"Hospital & Health Care, Self-employed",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,6-Sep-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: One stop shop for your next fundraiser! I was able to do a silent auction as well as sell raffle tickets. Payments were easy and I had no complaints from my attendees to our event regarding the process. I loved I could easily share on social media to get the word out on fundraiser. I did not utilize the ticket portion but would expect that would be smooth as well. Price was comparable to other products offered so I definitely made the right choice going with Accelevents!,Cons: I do not have anything bad to say here! Would highly recommend this product!,"Overall: Customer Service was great. When I had questions on functions or how my event was going to run, I got a response quickly and they were very easy to work with. I look forward to using Accelevents for my next fundraiser.",
accelevents,Staff is extremely helpful,Kevin C.,Director of Strategic Communication,"Education Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,8-Aug-18,5,5,4,5,5,10,,Pros: This site is easy to use and the staff is always on hand to help out if needed.

Easy to upload photos, details, prices, etc. Text to bid is AMAZING!!! End of auction reports were helpful for checkout without using cc processing thru Accelevents. Customer support via chat and email were on point...even during our event at 9pm at night they were there to answer questions.",Cons: No real issues with any details of software. All worked smoothly for the silent auction we had. Only suggestion is maybe consolidate the menus instead of having to click between so many to access different parts of the auction set up.,Overall: we were able to raise money by using this software for a silent auction. It was simple to tell people about how to bid and they were excited to keep getting text messages if they were outbid.,
accelevents,Awesome!,Glenda S.,National Fundraising Director,Non-Profit Organization Management,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,27-May-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Ease of use and ability to make changes even during the event. The support was amazing from day one, considering I wasn't the most techie person and had a lot of questions, they were patient with me! Everything was online immediately with details of winning bidders, made check out a breeze. We wanted to broaden our reach outside of the actual live auction, and even had bidders from the UK and Australia!",Cons: Not really anything. The only thing that would be nice is to have a total if the winning bidder had more than one item.,"Overall: Ease of use from administrator to user. Our target radiance is older and not tech savvy, we had helpers and then the people started helping others, it's that easy. The collection of funds eliminated following up and tracking of monies, it's all there for you.",
accelevents,Great Product!,Kayla C.,Event Organizer,"Computer Games, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,8-May-19,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: For our weekly gaming event, this product and service was perfect for our needs!

The site was easy to set up and the technical support was outstanding (only one real technical issue that was quickly fixed - mostly it was me asking a lot of questions that Zach and team responded to quickly). The connection to Stripe worked quickly and easily. I did make my own small donation through the site because the first payment through Stripe takes about a week - subsequent payments only take a couple of days, so I had the auction winner's money in my organization's bank account within 48 hours. We used it for a single item that the donor wanted auctioned off immediately, but I'll definitely be looking to use Accelevents again for my annual event's silent auction.",
accelevents,Godsend for a small non-profit organization!,Rebecca M.,Co-Chairperson,,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,30-Jan-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: After searching for an on-line silent auction program, I was disheartened to find that most companies charge a sizable overhead cost that was unreasonable for our small non-profit organization. Then there were additional fees to avoid advertisements and post multiple pictures. I was about to give up when I came across AccelEvents. I cannot say enough about the ease of the program and amazing customer support...all for an incredibly fair price! I look forward to working with cust support team again for next year's fundraiser and plan to utilize all of their services, from ticket sales, to basket raffle tickets, to the silent auction again.",,,

The staff offers prompt customer service and technical assistance easily through chat function. It was affordable for our non-profit fundraising event. Users can easily bid via text message without cumbersome downloads of apps or concern about internet connections.The web platform presented the art we had up for auction beautifully and provided a way to have a link to websites of artists who donated their work, as well as social network sharing links so folks could easily share with their friends the art they were bidding on.",,Overall: We were able to raise precious dollars for the organization we support.,

The software seemed very intuitive.,"Cons: Honestly, can't think of any.","Overall: We researched online and found Accelevents to be a great option. Once we got started, we were impressed by their customer service, so helpful and timely. And even more impressed with the functionality. Such a great option and value for the investment!",Recommendations to other buyers: It would have been nice if we could have a silent auction where the top 3 bidders could win the item.
accelevents,Used Silent Auction for a 6-hour fundraising event - great participation,Wanda T.,Volunteer,"Non-Profit Organization Management, Self-employed",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,29-Aug-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: Silent Auctions have two drawbacks 1) the event needs to be a short period of time and 2) chaos at the end is never easily managed. This option took care of BOTH of those and more for us. All I had to do was provide a picture and item description. Printable versions were easily available. Very easy to make changes.,"Cons: This is such a picky thing, but I do not like the ""Metro"" font on the website. Very difficult to see and when we projected the current bid screen it was not a good image for our bidders.",Overall: Earned more on our silent auction than ever before with much less effort,
accelevents,An excellent choice for smaller events,Mia W.,Development Director,,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,16-Apr-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Accelevents had everything we needed: text-to-bid, a website with item pages, a scrolling display for the event itself, an option for bidders to pay through their phones if they win and printable auction description sheets. The customer service was really good as well - we could just send a question through the chat and hear back within 5 minutes. They even managed to fix a timezone issue that cropped up during the event!",Cons: I would've liked a little more control over the speed at which the items scroll - some guests had trouble reading it.,,
accelevents,Really Easy to Use,Ashley K.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,1-Dec-15,5,5,5,5,5,10,Comments: I was able to use the Accelevents software at a charity event this November and it made everything really simple and effortless. The text functionality took out the guesswork and stress of bidding - it was a great experience. It was also exciting to see how many bids had been placed on certain items so I could keep track of what was really popular and which items I had a better chance of winning.,,,,
accelevents,"User friendly, increased participation engagement",Sose P.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,17-Feb-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,"Comments: The silent auction was easy to set-up, added a fun element to our event and increased participant engagement both in person and on the web.

accelevents,First Time E-Auction User,HAROLD H.,Board Member,,,NO,Source: Capterra,4-Jan-16,4,4,4,5,5,10,"Comments: The software solution works as indicated. Our guest experience with bidding, notifications and payments was very smooth. Although I wish I had a way to format my text for the actual auction description to highlight key points, I was able to get all of my bid info to display which is the critical piece.
