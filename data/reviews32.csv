oveit,All the features you need in one place!,Claudiu Petru C.,Marketing Director,"Transportation/Trucking/Railroad, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Jan 11, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: - Exceeds requirements

oveit,Perfect event management platform for various types of events,Mihai M.,Campaign Manager,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Jan 26, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: I love the versatility of the product. It can be applied to any sort of event: small events, medium events, or huge events. Oveit covers all the management needs that an event organizer has, as you can easily set up badges for the event, and have a complete and real-time access management. Another useful element is the embed function, which enables the event organizer to sell tickets directly from his website. This is very cost effective as a 3rd party ticket seller can be avoided. And one last thing... it's very easy to use. Big plus on that!","Cons: There are so many functions that sometimes you can mix them up, but any organizer can live with that con when you look at the many pros that Oveit has to offer.","Overall: I've used Oveit platform for the charity events organized for HOSPICE Casa Sperantei. We've sold tickets in a very smooth way and handled all the event infrastructure with just a couple of clicks. By using the embed system, we were able to sell tickets directly from the event homepage. Also, by collecting data from the people that purchased tickets, we were able to keep in contact with everyone, even after the event has ended.

For a charity that needs cost efficiency, Oveit was a perfect solution. The user experience for an organizer is great and it takes around 5 minutes to set up the event and get it going. Also, with just a couple of clicks to manage the whole event, manpower is reduced to minimum and because of Oveit, one man can do the job of many. Great job!","Recommendations to other buyers: Check out all the functions that Oveit has to offer and use them, as they will make your life easier."

We've used even some of the most praised apps out there. Trouble was that none of them was quite up to par with the set of features we needed (website embedding for the event registration form, customer vouchers, mobile app for check-in, payment integration and a couple more). Oveit came as an awesome surprise. Not only did they provide all the core functionality we sought for at the most reasonable price, they also went the extra mile for us more than once to help us set everything up and integrate with other services. We did find some small feature missing from their UX, but it was addressed real fast by the team. All or this with a cheerful tone in e-mails. They already have a good system, but it's clear that they are an Agile team that keeps improving. When you're looking for a top notch event management app that's great value for the money, Ctrl-D recommends Oveit!","Recommendations to other buyers: Do try it, it's a revelation!"
