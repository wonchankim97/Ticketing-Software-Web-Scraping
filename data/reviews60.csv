betterez,"Functional, Nifty, Ever Growing Reservation System.",JOE W.,CEO,"Transportation/Trucking/Railroad, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,nan,Source: Capterra,"Sep 20, 2016",4,4,4,5,4,8.0,,"Pros: All in one transportation reservation, manifest, and sales system.

Good Support.

Front Side simplicity and intuitive user friendly GUI that even our Senior/Non-tech savvy customers can use easily.","Cons: Some changes are slow and others happen like lightening- it makes for a bumpy ride at times, and soft/whiney employees can have a hard time dealing with the changes or lack there of.

The system does not have a simplistic, intuitive, or as yet, reliable accounting system to integrate into our bookkeeping or payroll- though I am told this maybe coming.","Overall: been using this product for over 4 years now- and we have had in grow with our business. In the beginning we were using home made database that was very specifically engineered to our needs, but wasn't capable (because of its age) of taking online reservations. We integrated the basic online component of Betterez into our system with a high degree of extra effort on our customer support staff side. Eventually we changed our in-house system and policies and made the move over to a Full Time Betterez system; this change was a little rough in the beginning but we received great support from the Betterez team and it worked out well. Now almost 5 years later we are still reaping the benefits of an up to date, supported, and growing reservation system. It has been wonderful to be a part of the development of the Betterez system.","Recommendations to other buyers: This has been a successful, customer friendly and positive system for our needs. I had looked into using interline reservation system with Greyhound and or Amtrak, but this was a much better choice for someone being focused on positive customer service experience."
betterez,Very good product that is so easy to use.,Scott W.,President,"Transportation/Trucking/Railroad, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,nan,Source: Capterra,"Dec 12, 2016",4,5,4,5,4,10.0,,"Pros: PROS - very easy program, fantastic follow-up, and support, customer support group are quick to respond, works very well","Cons: CONS -hopefully, some new features come along would like to have capabilities to do charter bookings and manifest as well as the line run ticketing, would like to have the ability to assign drivers and vehicle numbers to a manifest.","Overall: When we bought the company, ticketing was a manual process. We had books to keep track of passengers and availability and paper everywhere. We tried to have custom reservation platform built and it was an expensive lesson that did not even get off the ground. I got introduced to Betterez and had several conversations with their reps. I could not believe how much time these guys dedicated to me and my little company. Still, to this day, they both take a personal interest in what is going on and how we are making out with the program. Anytime I have a thought or request for a change, they listen and ask questions. Betterez is very simple to use and get onto using. I love that it is cloud-based, I can log in anywhere in the world from my phone or tablet. We very recently launched our online purchasing through our website, this is helping us provide our customers with another easy and safe method to check the availability of seats and to buy tickets. This will help me achieve my goal of being paperless.",Recommendations to other buyers: I would absolutely recommend Betterez to anyone. It has made our life easier.
betterez,A reservation system that grew my business,Yannick G.,IT Director,"Transportation/Trucking/Railroad, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Sep 28, 2018",5,5,4,4,5,10.0,,"Pros: Lots of great features like promo codes, bundled tickets and parcel.","Cons: I once experienced a bug in one of their features, but they resolved the issue within 24 hours.",Overall: This platform has essentially helped us to move from a traditional business model to a digital and competitive business model. All new features and tech upgrades ensure our business to be ahead of any new requirements in our industry. Through promo codes I was able to launch regular marketing campaigns which drove ticket sales. I now offer bundled tickets which allows my passengers to benefit from discounts on a regular basis. Their parcel feature has created a new line of business for me and added additional revenue - opening up the world of eFreight.

betterez,Great product!,Jared M.,President,"Transportation/Trucking/Railroad, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,nan,Source: Capterra,"Sep 06, 2016",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Easy to use as an operator, customer friendly for my passengers","Cons: If there are any, I haven't found them in my 5 years of using them","Overall: I began using the Betterez system for our College Coach Bus shuttle service in early 2012. From the start they were highly responsive to our needs and requests, building out their product with constant enhancements. Those improvements have continued and they are always introducing fantastic new additions and capabilities despite already having been a highly effective solution. They have constantly improved in every aspect, from the product to their customer service, with an organized vision for future enhancements that seems to be largely based on the requests of their customers. Similar services have tried to convert us over the years to their product, but when stacked up next to Betterez, they've all fallen short. They have proven their capability to provide a vital service for our business over and over and we will be using them for our new daily line run service, Catch-a-Ride. I have already recommended them to another operator and will continue to recommend them!",Recommendations to other buyers: I would absolutely recommend Betterez to anyone. It has made our life easier.

I can't really think of anything I don't like. The value is great. Features are all there for our business. The support is amazing and it's really easy to use.,Cons: No option for analytics. Landing page visitors look to be dropping off but it would be great if you could put in tracking code to see the behavior flow from the page to either drop off or to your betterez products page.,"Overall: We had a previous online reservation system that was costing quite a bit, was confusing to our customers, and was an overall pain to maintain and implement new trips or to revise current trips. Researched alternatives and Betterez won me over with their cost, ease of setup, and their customer support. It took a couple of days to setup our daily airport run, cross-state shuttle, and other seasonal trips.","Recommendations to other buyers: If you're looking for an easy to maintain reservation and ticketing system with superb customer service, Betterez is the way to go!"
betterez,It has been a pleasure working with Betterez to get our new service off the ground,Pat D.,Office Manager,"Transportation/Trucking/Railroad, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Jan 04, 2019",5,5,5,5,nan,10.0,,"Pros: Very useful and intuitive scanner, quick system implementation - launched go-live in two weeks, awesome and readily-available customer support team","Cons: So many features, so little time! We know there are other features of the platform that can help us be more productive - in time we plan on implementing them.","Overall: Since implementing Betterez our new service has forged ahead.

Has cut back on a lot of paperwork.","Cons: The only problem I do not like is going through a reservation and forgetting to add something, when you click the back button you lose all your information on the passenger.","Overall: I absolutely love the new style of Betterez, it is easier to read and maneuver. The 5 day Operations page is so easy to read, I also like that the Orange bar does not move anymore.

We appreciate the improvements recently made to the Betterez program and find it much more user friendly.

While it is a way of providing customer what they need, we are not fully utilizing the software the way it is intended to work. Customer is looking at switching to the online ordering feature but many modifications will need to be made to accommodate their needs.
