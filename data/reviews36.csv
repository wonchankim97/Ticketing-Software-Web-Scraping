ticketpeak,COULD NOT BE HAPPIER!!!,Lindsay M.,Musical Director,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Mar 14, 2013",5,5,nan,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: -AMAZING customer service. Probably the best customer service i've ever dealt with ever. Louis was available via email and phone and wrote back to emails immediately. I never felt stressed waiting for a call back from him b/c he was so prompt in getting back to me. I really wish all companies had someone as attentive and reliable as he was with ticketpeak.

-The site is very easy to maneuver through. At first i wasn't sure what to click and where to go but after playing around a little bit, it was mostly self explanatory and most people would have no problem using it.

-EXTREMELY quick in getting our site up and running. It was less than 24 hours from the time i sent Louis our seating chart and we started selling tickets.

-LOVE that you can add a jpeg logo to personalize tickets.

-It's GREAT that you can add messages on the ticket regarding the show.

-the reports the site provides are SOOOO informative and helpful afterwards.

-We received a ton of compliments.",Cons: I can honestly say that i cannot think of any cons of this site or the people that i dealt with. It really is a fabulous site and program and I have and will continue to recommend it to people who could benefit from it.,"Overall: We had decided this year to switch to online assigned seat ticketing so that it would be less work for us during the school day and less lines at the door due to the fact we were always general admission. We went back and forth on whether or not we wanted to do it and i look back now and i'm mad at the time we wasted making a decision because it was THE BEST DECISION we could have made. It saved us SOOO much time and aggravation and kept our lobby so much more pleasant. In the past people waited an hour or more on line so that they got a good seat. Now, people came 15-30 minutes before show time, could walk around the lobby and then go in to their assigned seats. We noticed we also sold a lot of merchandise in our lobby this year because people did not need to stand in line, which was an extra added bonus! DO NOT WASTE TIME, EMAIL TICKETPEAK TODAY!!! You will NOT be dissapointed!!! Thank you Louis for all your help!!!",

So easy to learn, and service is wonderful.",Dan D.,Executive Director,,Used the software for: 2+ years,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jul 13, 2017",4,5,4,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: Though perhaps not the most feature-rich option, TicketPeak is so easy to use that our all-volunteer box office staff can learn to use it in no time. And the rates are low so we don't have to worry so much about the bottom line.","Cons: There are enough options and enough reports to handle our basic operations, but a large organization may need something more robust.","Overall: We had decided this year to switch to online assigned seat ticketing so that it would be less work for us during the school day and less lines at the door due to the fact we were always general admission.

The upgrade to mobile-friendly was great. I like that we can upload an image to our tickets and edit the content, at least somewhat. Our switch from PayPal to the TicketPeak credit card processor resulted in far fewer payment problems!",Cons: The reports are pretty clunky and a bit confusing to download. It would be nice to archive old events such that they no longer show up on the reports option.

Our customers have asked for online technology for a long time and they are happy too with the ease of use of the software.","Cons: I would like to be able to make distinct groupings for our classes, I loaded Fall, Spring, March Breaks and they are one long list, it would be easier to see what you are looking for if there could be breaks in the listings. I'd love a bigger logo for our group too.","Overall: Our cash flow was better. We did paper registration and cheques/cash the first day of class. Now we have a continuous online registration. We are still converting people to online after all the years of being paper based. It's easy to print registration lists to know who's coming and how much room we have in the class.

The service itself is very easy to use, both for us and for those getting seats.","Pros: Louis Lamoureux is the absolute BEST person I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with. Instantly responsive to any question I've had and gives great advice and instruction. The product is imminently user-friendly and with Louis, very easy to setup and get started. I know that it has increased our sales even over the short period I've used it and the option to buy tickets online has not even been well publicized yet.","Cons: I would like to access the event report in the ""reports"" section without going to the ticket page. When entering events, I would like the option of entering multiple dates for each event without having to reenter the entire event. Would like a ""promotion"" option which would allow a bank of numbers to be assigned which buyer could enter for discount on individual tickets.","Overall: Great product at the best price. I certainly looked at many options and chose Ticket Peak. I highly recommend it to any organization. And, the service is absolutely outstanding.",

They are always available and helpful if you have questions or concerns.,"Cons: It would be nice if the software allow more flexibility in customizing your sites. It would be great to add pictures of your venue and add ""themes"" to your ticket ordering page. You can currently customize the tickets somewhat, but the ordering page is relatively bland .",Overall: This made the job of our box office volunteer much easier. It was a great simplification of the process. We especially like not having to handle credit card information and being able to look up seating for those who forgot their tickets.,

Events are customizable and new venues are easily uploaded to accommodate different seating charts.",Cons: very few cons we have found in using Ticketpeak.
