holdmyticket,Holdmyticket review,Garrett C.,Owner,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 17, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: There are so many features I like about this software. I like how simple it is to use. We appreciate the live ticketing purchase updates, The ease of which we can capture our repeat customers data. I like that I can build an event from my Iphone (if I need to) in a very short time. We can repeat events easily. It builds facebook events for us. I could go on and on but I like that the features are not hidden or hard to find- there are a probably over a hundred things the software can do for you and it's all self explanatory and simple to use.","Cons: I really have to think about this, but I would like to be able to manipulate the title of the events a little easier (font sizing, Italics, bold font, etc.) Other than that I honestly can't think of anything.",Overall: My overall experience with Holdmyticket has been extremely positive - hands on customer service second to none. The pricing also is very competitive.,
holdmyticket,Great Ticketing System,Gregg W.,Owner,"Music, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 21, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Easy to use, direct integration with my website and the fantastic support that we have received on the very rare occasion that we've needed it.","Cons: The only improvement that I can think of would be a better real time ticket purchase report to share with promoters. Emails are sent after every ticket purchase, but that email doesn't include the total number of tickets sold for a given event.","Overall: Have been using HMT for about 7 years as my only ticketing/gate point of sale and have never considered switching to one of the others that constantly send emails with reasons to use their system. HMT's software is simple to use no matter the size of the venue and in the rare occasion that we've needed any type of support, a HMT rep has always been there to help out. I would recommend HMT to anyone looking for an easy, hassle-free ticketing software with exceptional customer support!",

The ticketing side for my customers is easy to use and setting up events is very straight forward.,Cons: It would be great to have a little more control over the analytics regarding individual event tracking/page tracking as well as some sort of real time notifications via text or email as tickets are being purchased.

They always answer their phones and return emails.,Cons: Hard to come up with something here. There are more things I wish it did but they are willing to integrate or build API's and they are always agile.,"Overall: They under promise and over perform. The team at HMT is an absolute pleasure to work with and I couldn't ask for a better ticketing partner. So glad that we chose them over the ""Big Guys"" in the ticketing industry. 5 Stars all day!",
