You have to leave a message and wait for a call back from a technician which, is not always prompt. Really not fun when you have a long line of people waiting to purchase tickets and are having an issue.","Overall: Switched from TM 4 years ago and couldn't believe how much easier Etix was to use.

etix,Purchase was easy but after event got cancelled issues with part of my refund,H G.,,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jan 21, 2016",1,3,nan,1,nan,nan,"Comments: I purchased tickets to an event, the purchase process was easy and I had no issues. However, the event got cancelled. I contacted customer service to get the refund process started. They did not have any issues with getting the refund of the ticket price but there are fees added to each ticket that was purchased and they will not refund this amount. My initial refund request was done via email and all was handled fine for the ticket price but then I called in reference to the fees being refunded because the gentleman via email said no they would not refund the fees and no longer responded to any emails. I was told, when I called that they would take care of getting the fees refunded back to me as well but that never happened. so I followed up with them and was told there is no record of the phone call. I feel the fees should also be refunded because this was due to the event being cancelled. I will not use etix again and will look for other options to purchase tickets in the future to events.",Pros: I really enjoy using this software to buy tickets for concerts and events.
