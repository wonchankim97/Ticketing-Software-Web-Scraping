ticketfly,Easy to customize to organizations needs,Jade S.,Marketing,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 19, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Ticketfly has been our ticketing platform for 3+ years and we love it. Easy to customize to fit our needs and easy for the consumer to use. Support team is amazing as well and really goes above and beyond to help with whatever you need.,"Cons: They were recently acquired by Eventbrite so I think we'll eventually have to transition to their platform, which I think is way lower quality.",Overall: Amazing ticketing platform that is easy to use and makes us look really professional.,
ticketfly,Best ticketing system for small clubs & venues!,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Entertainment, 1001-5000 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"May 17, 2019",5,5,5,4,nan,8.0,,"Pros: Ticketfly is SUPER user friendly, and a common household name for purchasing tickets. It's a trusted site, easy to navigate, and makes it easy to sell tickets to events to customers.","Cons: In the back end, a user can't set anyone up for auto counts. Not a big deal, but I always have to contact an admin to get people set up for counts.","Overall: Overall, I would recommend ticketfly to any up and coming music club!",
ticketfly,My favorite ticketing company. Too bad it's going away,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Mar 31, 2019",5,5,5,nan,5,9.0,,"Pros: Super easy backend interface. I was never confused when working events where we sold tickets through Ticketfly! Audit reports and will call lists always easy to find, names never listed confusingly. All around solid.","Cons: That it got bought out by Eventbrite and is slowly transitioning all of its accounts onto that platform, which is more mobile-friendly but generally inferior in a lot of ways.",Overall: I miss you Ticketfly!,
ticketfly,I've used this for purchasing concert tickets,Ernie Z.,Graphic Designer,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 05, 2018",4,4,3,3,nan,nan,,Pros: I like the fact that it's super easy to use for purchasing tickets and it's pretty cool how they show a lot of other events/concerts going on so you can possibly check out more bands you like that are playing.,Cons: The service fees are annoying. I almost wish the ticket prices that are shown would just include any service fees and that sort of thing instead of getting me excited for the cost and then all of a sudden it bumps up with the extra costs.,Overall: I miss you Ticketfly!,
ticketfly,Ticketfly is pretty fly,Chris H.,Security Analyst,"Information Technology and Services, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,nan,Source: Capterra,"Apr 19, 2017",5,5,5,5,3,5.0,,Pros: Quick and easy to search and purchase tickets,Cons: Services fees are absolutely ridiculous and greatly increase the cost of tickets.,"Overall: I've only used ticketfly a couple times but it worked well and I got my tickets and was admitted to the show without any issues. Much like other ticket vendors it all goes sour when you purchase multiple tickets and then get hit with the service fees at the end. Paying service fees for an electronic ticket is absolute bull crap and shouldn't be allowed. Much like Ticketmaster, Ticketfly uses these fees to pad their bottom line and generate revenue. I always suggest purchasing tickets from the venue box office but if you must...ticketfly is as good as the rest at getting you tickets from the convenience of your pc.",
ticketfly,Solid alternative to Ticketmaster,Paolo C.,Senior Ad Tech Associate,"Marketing and Advertising, 5001-10,000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 29, 2019",4,5,5,nan,4,7.0,,"Pros: Seems to be less clunky than Ticketmaster and the fees aren't exorbitant. Pretty easy to use and I always like the option of getting hard tickets . Never had to wait in a ""virtual waiting room"" for any events thru this site., which is nice.","Cons: I've seen some shows that only sell digital tickets, which I don't always prefer. Also I tried transferring tickets to a friend once and their support said I couldn't for some reason....wasn't really clear as to why.",Overall: Overall pretty good. Don't usually expect much from ticketing software companies as they seem to all be very similar as far as how they work and their fees.,
ticketfly,"Completely unsuccessful, from product performance through customer service.",Richard V.,Founder and President,"Accounting, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jun 18, 2017",1,1,1,1,nan,nan,,"Pros: Seems to be less clunky than Ticketmaster and the fees aren't exorbitant.

I attempted to use Ticketfly to purchase tickets to an Austin City Limits Moody Theatre event in Austin, Texas.",Overall: None. Ticketfly was a complete and utter waste of user time. Yield to this consumer was negative.,

The ticket choice menus are simple and easy to understand. Comes in handy when you are looking for that band that you've been waiting to see for ages!,"Cons: I guess there is no real negative to Ticketfly. I am just not a fan of reselling tickets in general, but understand that other than obvious scalpers (and there are many out there), things happen, and you may need to sell your ticket to a show for some reason.",Overall: None. Ticketfly was a complete and utter waste of user time. Yield to this consumer was negative.,

It integrates easily with my social media pages, it's easy for my crowd to navigate and gathering sales info is wonderful. I love the how easy the code is to incorporate in my website and the IOS app ticket scan is a life saver. Now that it's combined with eventbrite I've grown my audience significantly",Cons: I can't think of any cons at the moment but it's website could like a little cooler.,Overall: None.

They also did not indicate when they would ship and I had a hard time getting those questions answered,Overall: Overall a very positive experience!,
