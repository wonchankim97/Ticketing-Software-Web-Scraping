sro4,SRO4 saved us!,Alex C. D.,Box Office Manager,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Oct 16, 2015",4,4,nan,5,nan,nan,"Comments: In retrospect, I'm still unclear how we were able to function with our old ticketing system. It wasn't until we officially launched SRO4 as our new and improved ticketing system that we became aware of how horrifyingly lacking our previous system was. It's like realizing you accidentally dodged a lethal bullet by virtue of stopping to tighten an unruly shoelace. SRO4 is essentially the shoelace that saved our lives.

I've used numerous different systems during my thirteen years ticketing performing arts organizations, and SRO4 holds its own when compared to some of the bigger names out there. Compared to our previous system, SRO4 is far more intuitive and offers a user-friendly ticketing experience. The reports in SRO4 are a great surprise, offering the flexibility to craft reports specific to the unique demands of our organization while actually reporting back data accurately and in a clean, digestible format.

SRO4's biggest flaw lies in its rules and conditions based logic that applies to almost every aspect of this system. For all of SRO4's brains, it seems to overthinks things too much. For example, programming a specific fee structure for one scenario and differently for another is frustrating beyond words due to the necessity of chiseling through a healthy list of conditions that act as the 'on/off switch' for the fee scenarios. No matter how intelligent you are, you'll quickly find yourself wishing you'd paid closer attention in rocket science class. And with so many layers of interlaced rules and conditions, a slight modification can completely disrupt the functionality of another rule/condition combo that you worked so hard to perfect a week prior. If there's lemonade to be made of these tart lemons, it's that you're guaranteed to come up with some creative combinations of obscenities that are guaranteed to make any sailor blush.

Despite that frustration, the best part of SRO4 is the support we're getting from the TopTix team. These folks are friendly, results-driven, and fast! Did I mention that they're also pleasant and easy to get along with? You bet I did. And I'll say it again, because these essential qualities seem to be withering in the support industry in general. And if you can't enjoy a professional yet relaxed relationship with your support team, well...what's to enjoy? I really love these rock stars! No matter what my situation might be, I always hang up the phone feeling like I'm in good hands with my team.",,,,
