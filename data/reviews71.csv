bookitbee,Metropolitan Grand Lodge & Bookitbee,ben j.,Web Master,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jun 13, 2014",5,5,nan,5,nan,nan,"Comments: When we were 1st introduced to the bookitbee system I was over all impressed by the ease of use and the functionality of the system. My initial reaction was ""GET IT"", ""GET IT NOW"" and I am pleased to say the boss listened and we started using the system. We now have a wondefully easy system for our members to book seminars and events, which previously was done by using our systems and taking cheques, which meant we had to make sure people had paid, booked etc. which was a long drawn out process. Now all that has been taken out of our hands and sits very well in Kenton & bookitbee's capable hands.

Another thing I have found is their knowledge and customer/tech support team are great to get along with and will help you out very rapidly and keep you informed along the way.",,,,

bookitbee,BookitBee for PTA events,Claire W.,Director,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jun 25, 2014",5,5,nan,5,nan,nan,Comments: We have used BookitBee to manage the ticketing for a couple of the bigger annual PTA events ( including Fireworks night) we have held in the last couple of years and found it to be super easy to set up and use. It was the first time we had used an online ticketing system for these events (normally the several hundred tickets would only be sold in the playground) and we saw an increase in the take up of tickets almost immediately. This I think was partly due to being able to send around general links and share the event on facebook (reaching a bigger audience) and also the ability for people to pay online securely. We will now use BookitBee for all PTA events and as a result for many other community events and would highly recommend it.,"Pros: Easy to use, flexible, low cost",Cons: None,"Overall: I have used Bookitbee for about a year now and they have been brilliant.

It's quite a flexible and allows you to customise practically everything (background, colour highlights etc). The UX is really clear, with lots of feedback ('changes saved', 'have you checked the pricing?' etc).","Pros: Easy to use, flexible, low cost",Cons: None,"Overall: I have used Bookitbee for about a year now and they have been brilliant.
