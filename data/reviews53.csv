arts people,Arts People has helped my small community theatre in many ways resulting in higher revenue.,Leira S.,Artistic Producing Director,,Used the software for: 2+ years,nan,Source: Capterra,"May 10, 2017",5,5,5,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: It is easy to use , comprehensive and Arts People's customer service is the best I have had anywhere (I wish local waiters were as helpful as AP's client services department!). With integrated ticketing and donor services we now know much more about our patrons, how best to reach them, and what they respond to. The result is higher ticket sales, larger and more frequent donations, and generally stronger support of our little theatre. That the software integrates seamlessly with our website and products like Mailchimp and Facebook is a big plus. The help desk is full of articles which are clear and videos which give step by step instructions for the visual learners among us. But the strength of AP is it's people. Every person I have had contact with is a theatre artist. Because of that they really get my organization, why things I think are critical really are (so nice not to have to convince people of what is important!), and how to best solve whatever problem I am having. Recently they have been expanding their marketing tools. I know that there are many more benefits awaiting my organization if I fully utilize the products that Arts People offer. And, Arts People is CRAZY affordable, with very low start up costs and below market fees. Truly the best investment we have made at Ferndale Repertory Theatre.",Cons: They have not yet solved global warming. I am sure they will get on that when they have a free minute.,,

We chose better than we knew!!","Pros: The Ticket Turtle online ticketing system has literally changed our whole world. As a small and growing company, we struggled for years with providing our audiences with a high quality, accessible and easy to use ticketing systems. Ticket Turtle is not only user friendly from the purchasers perspective, it is also incredibly easy to use as an administrator. There are dozens of reports that give you an up to the minute view of all aspects of your ticket sales, detailed database forms to track your audiences, a very flexible donations and contributions system that makes getting donations from patrons a breeze (not to mention generating automatic thank you emails the instant the donation is received) and a versitile ticket pricing system. We will never use another ticketing system, particularly given the incredible level of customer service we have consistently received. We. Love. Ticket. Turtle.","Cons: The only issue we have ever encountered is with the contributions system where it is difficult to process multiple purchased types in a single transaction (ie...buy a ticket, buy season tickets and make a donation all in one transaction). I believe, however, that TT is addressing this for a future version. I would also love to have the option of having TT staff act as ticket sales/phone staff and hope that TT goes down that road to provide that service in the future.",Overall: We love this system and will never use another ticketing system.,

And they did answer our ticketing problems - what they didn't state was that they also would answer my patron management and marketing questions. Having a unified system to manage our patrons allowed us to go from 600 patrons on a hard copy mailing list to over 2400 patrons on our email list and 600 patrons on direct mail only.,Cons: None ! In 4 years I have had less than 5 patrons complain about the ticketing interface.,"Overall: If you need a ticketing and patron management system - this is the one you want.

Over 90 reports available, but some seem to duplicate information. End of Show Reports currently do not include upgrade income in the sales numbers. I have had to add these in manually in an Excel Spreadsheet to balance with our deposits. Currently unable to refund back to credit cards, which is inconvenient; patrons have to wait for a refund check to be mailed to them.","Overall: Overall, I highly recommend Ticket Turtle for ticketing needs.",

Donor tracking

Both snail mail and email capable

Excellent report system

Levels of security for box office/management

Graphic display allows online users to choose seats

Hand-holding during setup and training

First class support

Simple to use for online customers

Seamless integration with your website",Cons: Can't think of any.,"Overall: The setup charges were in the lower range compared to other systems. It has a flexible list and email system. We use it to track our volunteers among other things. It has a membership and donation tracking system as well. Their robust report system provides every kind of information about tickets, comps, donations, and anything else you can think of. They will adjust your pricing for special shows, groups, or whatever, or if your skills are good enough, you can adjust the pricing yourself.



The support from Ticket Turtle has been fantastic! They bend over backwards to make setup go smoothly. Its never been more than a couple hours wait from the time I post a problem or question on their online help request form. And that includes weekends!



The real test of the system for online transactions is the end user. As people enter our theater with their paper in hand, I ask them about buying tickets online. Almost everyone says, It was really easy!",

arts people,Ticket Turtle,Cyndy B.,Ticket Administrator,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jul 28, 2009",4,5,nan,3,nan,nan,"Comments: This program is easy to use, very intuitive. Easy to set up shows and integrate with your website. Some capabilities are limited in regards to reporting, enrollment, invoicing (not available), separating categories. The customer service is pretty good, but I feel like sometimes they don't fully read the email inquiry I send so their response doesn't answer my query. This is a great platform for a company/organization that needs a basic to moderate program for their ticketing needs. I foresee this program continuing to improve over the years.","Pros: Ease of use for office as well as clients
