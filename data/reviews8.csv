Tix Cares! *Best ticketing Company...Bar none.,Beatriz B.,Marketing Coordinator,"Gambling & Casinos, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 20, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Customer service is the BEST! No words can describe the amazing service Tix provides.,"Cons: Not many people know about Tix. If more people knew, Tix would be the #1 ticketing system in the world!","Overall: I had no background on ticketing systems, Tix manager took me under his wing and now I can create events in minutes. Our reo gives a personalized customer service, based on your company's needs. He's patient and he has a great team, he's the very definition of a good manager. Experiencing a big ticketing company right now and it's disappointing of how poor the training and the customer service is. when you think of a big corporation you think they'll have and provide all tools needed to succeed. In reality, they care about the high fees and selling but not caring how it gets done. Tix cares about the success on both parties and they care about customers providing low fees. Each account is a priority to Tix, they help as much as they can. To a big company, 1 account is nothing, and they make you do the job for them. Tix also cares when creating a new venue map, their team must be geniuses because all I have to do is send them a PDF and they do the rest (at no cost), at the same time they let you know if something doesn't look right of if you missed a row or a seat number. They've saved me from a few mistakes and embarrassment, instead they help me succeed and look good to my superiors. If you're looking for a ticketing company Tix is the right choice. No question is stupid or not important to our rep, he never acts like he is too good to answer he never makes you call the appropriate person to help you, if you have an issue he's there. Thank you!",
"Couldn't be more pleased with Tix, Inc.'s web based Box Office software!",Carleton U.,Treasurer,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Apr 04, 2016",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: After much research into the various vendors for on-line ticket sales, Zanesville Community Theatre, Inc., a small community theatre in Zanesville, Oh, made the leap into on-line and and off-line credit card sales in June 2004 with Tix, Inc. At the time, ZCT didn't have the CC transactions necessary to support our own merchant account. Tix, Inc. supported us with their merchant account.",,,,
TIX is the answer we needed--Great support and patron experience,Jennifer E.,Data Systems Coordinator,"Religious Institutions, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,"Oct 13, 2016",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Patron experience is excellent. Help library is great. Customer support is excellent.,"Cons: Sometimes the reports do not output to excel correctly, but the developer said this is a known issue and is being resolved.","Overall: We wanted an easy-to-use system where patrons could select their own seats for events in a 1500-seat venue and our smaller 450-seat theater. Going from our old paper system to TIX was a great decision. We were looking for a reasonable fee structure and solid customer support--TIX has both. Another feature that was important for us was to be able to hide the fee for certain events and TIX makes that easy to do. Sales reports, customer data and back-end management are easy to use and the TIX help library is excellent--anything I have not been able to figure out has been quickly responded to from TIX support via phone or email. I've also been impressed by the personal rapport of my support specialist--when I call, she knows who I am and is familiar with our organization's venues and events. I'm sure she has many clients to attend to, but I have had excellent response to each call or email--always within the same day!

Many of our patrons are older and I have heard nothing but positive responses from those who have attempted to make online purchases through TIX. We have some who call or walk in for a ""box office"" experience, and those orders are easily handled. Since our TIX site is branded to look like our own website, many purchasers do not even recognize they have left our website to make their purchase.

TIX is exactly what we were looking for.",
The Excellent Customer Service has made working with this system a breeze!,Rita A.,Box Office Manager,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 04, 2016",4,4,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: I have worked with these people and this system for seven years working for three companies. While there are some glitches, overall the system is simple to use and the Customer Service is outstanding! They have enabled me to streamline processes that were consuming more time than humanly endurable with the automatic renewal system. They advise me of the system parameters and what it can do for me, and have educated me to use it proficiently throughout the years. They take ownership of my problems and resolve them by whatever it takes to get the job done, including being most accommodating customizing reports, seat maps, customer letters, emails, etc. as needed and adapting their programming to meet my unique needs, a rare option in this world! I have never experienced more concern for my issues and dedication to resolving them than I have with this staff of experts. They continually enhance and improve their system and incorporate my requests whenever possible. They are truly committed to excellence going above and beyond providing extraordinary Customer Service and are quick to respond to my often urgent needs and resolved issues I deemed hopeless. They listen to my problems, have eased my frustrations and spent hours and hours on the phone with me and my complications over the years. I have worked with other systems that had no one to talk with and no ""phone a friend"" option which I found unbearable. Although I have never met any of the staff, I regard them as my friends as I am the friend in need and they are the friends indeed!",,,,

The staff is helpful and friendly and provide a timely response to inquiries. They also provide a good turnaround time on new programming requests.

Cons: No longer have the ability to do seat swaps and re-open orders. This option is now only available if we provide the credit card processing. With Tix customer service not available after hours, when most events take place, this has created problems on show day.",,,,

"Easy, efficient and inexpensive!",Ellie S.,Director of Visitor Services,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jun 24, 2015",5,5,5,5,4,9.0,"Comments: We used to spend countless hours chasing tickets and providing maintenance for our ticket printers. As a service provider, when it came time to determine what system to use for printing tickets and tracking customer support issues, I knew there were a lot of choices. I looked into ticketing systems I have used in the past that require a lot of support and local maintenance and found a few light weight systems that I could install myself. Since coming on board in 2008, Tix.com has been n amazing support system for our company.

These days, I try modeling our own support after Tix. com's. The service is great, the product is awesome, and they have an extensive help center to help answer any questions. The ticketing service itself is intuitive and easy to use. Would definitely recommend it!. It's very convenient and we now have the right tool to support our guests.",,,,

Great customer service and support!,Cindy H.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 10, 2016",4,3,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: The software itself is not something easy to learn on your own. There are a lot of minor but important steps that you have to really know when you are setting up an event prior to activating to the public. The menu selection, description, and navigation is not clear cut and I find myself jumping around to find things. There are also a lot of menu selections that can be consolidated. We are probably only using 15% of the functions that you offer and the rest are repetitive. I am a software developer myself so I have a slight idea on what I am talking about :)",,,,
Great experience with Tix,Krista S.,Special Events Coordinator,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 11, 2016",5,4,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: Greatly appreciate the wonderful customer service with Iris, she always worked hard to meet our needs with our events and went above and beyond in the way that she helped and always gave assistance quickly. She was always easy to get a hold of and offered detailed help both to assist and enable to do it oneself. This was a much better experience when we were switched to be under her care and management.

I find the layout of Tix to be difficult to learn from the back end, and still find myself searching for certain functions even after using it for two events now. This could be more user friendly/intuitive for those who aren't used to these type of systems.

Love all the different options with Tix, with so many variables for surveys, donations, coupon codes, etc. There is so much you can do with your event which is very helpful for complex events.

Overall very happy with Tix and glad we chose to go with them again for our second event.",,,,

We are glad we signed up! Easy to use with a clear interface.,Recommendations to other buyers: Really like the support staff . I am not the most tech savvy person in the world and they explianed things very clearly. Once I learned the system - I would now say it's a breeze.

Its a learning curve,Robyn F.,Special Events Coordinator,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 19, 2015",4,3,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: Although there are a lot of components to setting up ticket sales of multiple types, at multiple price points and with multiple distribution options, I wish the Tix system was a little more user friendly. I'm a reader and generally very adapt with new software and I struggled to navigate the system for the first time. I required a lot of customer support, which was excellent, its just a burden to ask 50 questions to accomplish one task. It might have been nice to see a tutorial video to lessen the excessive amount of hand holding for newbies. Now that I understand the system, it's a piece of cake, the beginning was rough. Our service rep was very helpful, thorough and attentive, I appreciate his help more than I can say!",,,,
I always get the answer and instruction that I need from a friendly staff.,Pamela J.,Operations Manager,"Entertainment, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Sep 29, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: The software is straight forward in it's set up. To set up an event, one simply clicks through the pages inserting production information and then it's finished. If there are modification, that is easily done by clicking on ""modify event"". An instruction video along with tabs and menus walk one through the steps and tech support always has a real person available, not automation.","Cons: Our company is in North Carolina and Tix.com is in California. The time difference is the only issue, but even with that, there is an emergency number so support is always available.","Overall: Simplicity of use, affordable price and consistent tech support.",

We do a lot of the same type of shows, so having features that allow us an easy way to setup 6 performances is a real benefit.","Cons: Nothing. We haven't had any complaints at all. I would say the cost, but in the end it costs us about what the credit card swipe fees would cost.",Overall: We are a community theater that puts on 3 or so shows a year. Tix.com is easy to use and has support that gets directly back to you and help you!,
NMTA Annual Event Tix Review,Jacob O.,Account Manager,1-10 employees,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jun 30, 2016",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Cost, ability to customize seating arrangements, ability to pass cost along to end user. Customer service was great!",Cons: Our only issue was checking in our guests at the event in a timely manner. This is largely a planning issue on our part. We didn't make proper use of the bar code on the tickets.,Overall: This is the first time I have used a program like this. I had looked for one in the past for another business I am involved in but the costs were too high. This product is very affordable for smaller productions and events such as ours. Iris was super helpful in the process and was always very prompt in attending to our questions and concerns.,
Tix Review,Michael D.,President,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 22, 2015",5,4,4,4,5,10.0,"Comments: Overall Tix.com has done a great job for my company. Patti has been outstanding and always eager to help with any issue that may arise. I would like to see more youtube videos how to operate analytic for Tix. I don't use the analytics that often and could refer to a youtube video to refresh my memory. The report I use most often is pulling concert attendees and inserting their email address into MailChimp.

Also wish there was a way customers could download dates to their calendar when purchasing tickets.",,,,
"Tix gives us real-time event information, and an easy online ticketing solution for our patrons.",Sherry I.,Development Coordinator,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 24, 2016",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,"Comments: We chose to partner with tix.com two years ago, and we are so glad we did. Our office had been keeping track of ticket sales and patrons on an Excel spreadsheet. Unfortunately, it was too easy to make an error, which resulted in multiple patrons having the same seat. Being a community college foundation, Tix offered the affordable solution we were looking for, and also offered the option to have reserved seats. Tix makes selling tickets through the box office so easy, and patrons can receive a purchase confirmation and their tickets via email. Tix goes above and beyond to provide excellent customer service! In the future, I hope Tix will consider providing a quick reference guide for their end users. Overall, our experience with Tix has exceptional.",,,,

A great product.,Robert M.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 26, 2015",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,Comments: The only complaint I have had is from my customers is they find the task of recovering thier password to be too difficult.

Excellent ticketing software for setting up events and managing ticket sales,Judith M.,Producer,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Oct 27, 2015",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: Once you gain familiarity with the software, it is easy to set up events on your own and manage the entire ticket process. I have been using the software for the past three years for the Westside Ballet of Santa Monica's two annual productions. It is very easy to use as an event manager and the customer service response when I have questions is prompt and helpful. The ticket production is efficient. There is helpful information on the site that allows you to figure out how to do many transactions.

The only negatives that we receive from customers buying tickets is that sometimes, there are difficulties with credit card processing or they have problems entering account information.",,,,
This has made running a theater and selling tickets on-line so much easier!,Sebastian F.,Owner and Operator,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 02, 2016",5,4,5,5,5,10.0,Comments: Tix has been a great addition to my business. I was searching for a company that would allow me to use my own credit card processing while still allowing me to have all the benefits of a ticketing software. Once I got the hang of the software it has been really easy to use and if I ever have a problem or issue I can call or e-mail my account rep and he helps me fix the situation.
