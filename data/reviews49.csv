tick-it!,Tick-It solves all your information records in one program,Ronald E.,Box Office Manager,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,nan,Source: Capterra,"Dec 06, 2016",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: The flexibility and ability to make our own changes on the fly.,"Cons: The fact that NCSoftware doesn't have 24 hours a day helpline. But that is also the same complaint our patrons have about us! We are only staffed at the Box Office on Wednesday and Friday afternoons, however, with most of our patrons with the internet they are able to conduct business with us either on our website or via e-mail.","Overall: After reviewing and considering about 6 different ticketing programs, we decided that Tick It offered the most value and could provide us with any reports we might want. We were looking for a system that we could use just in the house and then at a later time put on-line. Since we were able to keep the program and data on our own computers we were able to access data at any time and create queries to get info in a useful format for us. Tech Support is great they have helped solve any problems in a quick and efficient manner. The only thing that is a little inconvenient is the time difference between Michigan and California. But we have never had a ""crisis"" that kept us from operating because of this. We are able to record just about anything we want to track in each customer profile.

We are able to issue gift certificates, flex passes, coupons, season tickets, and reports for our patrons listing their donations. We are able to train volunteers to use the ticketing system very quickly. NCSoftware is constantly improving the programs adding features - even some at our suggestion. When we expanded and put our ticketing online, NCSoftware was available to answer all our question in getting it set up on our own server. Although Chautauqua Playhouse is probably one of NCSoftware's smallest venues they assist us with any problems or changes that we come up with. We are a venue with 96 seats, but we have many of the same needs that a much larger venue would benefit from. We are able services for our patrons that we were not able to do before, like ticket exchanges completed over the phone, patrons don't have to worry about turning in their old tickets to get their new ticket. The system cancels the ticket number of the exchanged ticket and issues a new ticket which is printed in our office as well as emailed to the patron One of the new features added was a reminder email is sent to each patron reminding them the show they are scheduled for, it is sent one or two weeks before the date and then again on the date of the performance, our patrons really appreciate this feature. I would recommend this program for any venue looking for a new system, or upgrading from another provider.",Recommendations to other buyers: We also use this software at our snack bar to facilitate inventory control and POS terminal. Training for the volunteers who staff our snack bar has been very easy - although some wish we would go back to the cigar box for collecting money!

New Concepts set up our football stadium design from our information so that we can sell the same seats to season ticket holders year after year.

Love the program - easy to use and maintain.
