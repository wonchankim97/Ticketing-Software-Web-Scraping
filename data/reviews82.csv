audienceview,Top-of-the-line Ticketing Software,Taylor M.,Director,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Mar 24, 2016",5,5,nan,5,nan,nan,"Comments: I've had the benefit of working with this software at two organizations in different locals; this is by far the most flexible and powerful ticketing system I have seen thus far! The versatility offered by the AudienceView platform makes it good solution for Arts, Athletics, and Academic ticketing needs, as well as more complex ticketing events such as large-scale concerts, commencement ceremonies, and even film festivals. The built-in correspondence tool is a strong component of the product offering and is something my organization has come to rely on. It has allowed us to develop a more frequent, targeted relationship with our customers through-out the ticketing experience. It also works in unison with the membership tool, which can be configured to handle our subscriptions, memberships, ticket passes/packages, and more. Once our guests have enjoyed the event we're presenting, the software has a diverse set of reporting tools that can isolate and refine our data - the sky is the limit. One last important tool to note is the online content management tool. We operate multiple white-label branded websites from the system with ease.",,,,

While our main goal is to sell tickets, we are also able to sell merchandise, accept donations, and integrate AV with other department's software to get accurate data transmitted each day. Not only is it beneficial to our Sales & Service office; Marketing staff can easily access sales reports and our Development officers can get a quick biography of a donor or prospect while also having the ability to view their ticket history.",,,,

I like how I can change most settings to be specific to my needs and how I can filter information for all of the users who sell within the system. It is easy to train users because i can really lock down what they can and cannot do depending on their expertise.

audienceview,To many steps to get one thing done,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Performing Arts, 201-500 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Dec 04, 2018",3,3,2,3,2,5.0,Comments: I have been using AudienceView since 2009.

It is easy to train users because i can really lock down what they can and cannot do depending on their expertise. AudienceView has also been able to accommodate new sales initiatives as they come up which helps increase revenue and respond to upper management requests.,Pros: I like how it is all online. I am able to access it anywhere and fix something.,"Cons: You have to go through so many steps to get one thing done. We use this to sell tickets for our patrons and when I want to set them up with tickets, I have to go through 10 different steps to get to the person. Then when you get the show selected, need to make sure you always click the ""update"" button or it messes the whole order up. Just needs to simplify some of the steps to get the process done smoother",,
