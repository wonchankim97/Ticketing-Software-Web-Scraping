"Great product, and support team at Vendini",Jack S.,Managing Director,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 23, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: Vendini ticket agent software is very user-friendly for selling tickets/donations/memberships/ etc. With the part-time box office staff typical turnover, it is great to be able to get staff up selling tickets. I can train new staff to do a sale, exchange, and refund within an hour. We have over 75,000 patrons per year, over 1000 performances and hundreds of different producers. We also produce our own festivals and programming and most other festivals in our 4 theatre complex. With this variety, we need a system that was flexible and works well with our eyes and.. attitude toward requests from our tenants. Vendini is approachable and focused on making the product work for us. They create a very personal connection to their customers and their support. I can be in touch several times a month trying to accommodate a request from one of our tenants, be it a certain type of reporting, or a membership/package they want to offer. I take these to my rep who works with the appropriate team to accommodate our needs. They have helped me create several specialized reports that give specific producers exactly what they want. They have helped me create seating venues that accommodate special pricing, sections, levels etc. . They have shown me useful ways to use memberships and fees. There have been many upgrades the past couple years, Email Marketing, reporting, ticket agent and patron manager. It's great to work with a company that listens to customers. Great possibilities!","Cons: The software is great, but of course not perfect. It can take time and some trial and error to get reports created how you want them. I feel there could still be work to do in this area. Support area is terrific and helpful, especially with urgent/time sensitive requests, but can take a bit longer when it is not priority. I think this is because they take time to find the right team, to give the best answer to solve the issue.",,
Vendini came on to our radar at exactly the right time with the right features to get the job done.,Charles J.,Producing Artistic Director,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 13, 2018",5,4,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Vendini, on top of being a box office system, is a complete marketing solution. It offers you the ability to combine your patron databases into one centralized location and then build the database automatically as your attendance increases. You can then use this information for email marketing (a similar system and set up to Constant Contact but I think more intuitive), direct mailings and patron management (such as the scheduling of development activities). The ability to review patron history is invaluable. And you can customize the tagging and grouping of patrons to suit your needs. Additionally, the software provided a website solution for us.",,"Overall: It has changed the way we do business. I can directly attribute our success in the recent years to our implementation of this program. It decreased workload, increased quality of output and made our patrons stand-up and take notice. Vendini continues to make upgrades to areas of the system. They recently added a patron database management section with basic development tools like the ability to schedule calls or tasks. And their email marketing recently got a facelift. So some of my biggest concerns are being addressed.",
Easy event set up with the ability to sell tickets without worry and to work on other projects.,Andrew M.,Associate Music Director,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jan 11, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: The best part of this software is that it is cloud-based, easy to navigate and setup, they give you template/dimensions for graphics, and the sales interface is easy for anyone in the office to grasp. By the time someone has typed a donation letter, I've already processed payment and printed the tickets. It is, hands down, the best ticket system for managing not only the ticket sales, but the relationship with the customer. Yeah, I could do a one-time ticket sale with EventBrite or BrownPaper Tickets (whatever they're called), but I don't have a long running capture of deep customer spending and attendance history.","Cons: The only thing that we ran up against was that pew style seating is hard to section off in the software and, inevitably, it was easier to create general ""rooms"" for reserved sections rather than using the seating chart for a church sanctuary. It's wonderful for theater seating!",,
I have used Vendini for two years as an online ticketing system for events.,Verified Reviewer,Associate Music Director,"Higher Education, 201-500 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 03, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Vendini offers several options to enhance your experience when selling tickets for an event or show. You are able to use your website and logo as well as the logo of the band or event you are selling tickets for. My favorite option is the ability to add a donation to individual's purchases. I worked with a Foundation that was raising funds for scholarships. Being able to add an additional donation button gave me the opportunity to earn additional funds for my Foundation. In addition, I loved the marketing portion. To be able to send an email to patrons through vendini instead of constant contact was super easy.",Cons: The function that I liked the least was that you are limited to character usage and design when it comes to marketing your events. Sometimes the buttons are difficult to use and change when trying to make the email blasts more appealing.,,
Vendini is the ideal box office and integrated website solution for our organization.,Jeremy A.,Senior Subcontract Specialist,Defense & Space,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 01, 2018",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: The integration with the website and online box office is one of the best features of Vendini. The box office software and apps are extremely easy to use have worked flawlessly with not lag or interruption. Our ticket sales have increased significantly since using Vendini, and season ticket subscribers increased from 10 to 45 in one year. Our fundraising has increased too as patrons easily add tip jar donations to each ticket purchase. Vendini customer service is outstanding - every person I have ever spoken with, email, or chatted with is polite, responsive, and knowledgeable. The additional features of credit card processing, equipment rental, patron database, email marketing, and more, Vendini is truly and all-in-one solution that we highly recommend.","Cons: Apps are not compatible with Android devices; and inability to sell gift cards while using Vendini credit card processing. But honestly, there isn't much NOT to like.",,
Outstanding Ticketing and Marketing Software,Daniel K.,Performing Arts Department Chair,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 16, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Ease of use

Patron building

Marketing

Professional appearance",Cons: Wish I had more hours in the day to utilize all the features of the program.,"Overall: I have been using Vendini now for over 7 years. The system is used across our Performing Arts Department at a large urban high school. I do not have a staff other than the students in the class. This is what is so wonderful about Vendini, it can do a little or it can do a lot. The students who are trained on the program are learning industry standard Arts Management skills. It goes well beyond just ticketing but also incorporates easily social media such as email and Facebook. Since using the program our shows sell out, revenue is way up, and we are able to have an impressive professional face. I cannot say enough good things about the services the program offers. In fact, it has been so successful that our district, the second largest in California, is taking it district wide based on the success and recommendations from my site.",Recommendations to other buyers: It will change how you market your shows! It will make ticket sales exciting for you and your staff. The reports features and ability to use the program on tablets and phones will have you checking sales in the middle of the night just for fun :-)
"A very complete solution that has helped us with ticketing, marketing and patron management.",Carl G.,Concert Manager,"Music, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Oct 03, 2017",4,4,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: All the major functions are completely integrated: ticket sales, online sales, marketing, patron management and reporting. Setup of new events is a snap.","Cons: The reporting features seem to do what we want but it can be difficult to figure out what you need to do to get the report you want. On the other hand, the customer support is always there to help and explain things as needed. The email functionality needs to be updated as well--not terribly modern looking emails, and the functionality is a bit buggy.","Overall: Helped us sell more tickets by giving us online ticket sales, email marketing, reporting and patron management all in one package.",
Excellent product with even better customer service!,Verified Reviewer,Concert Manager,,Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,"Apr 26, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: -Ease of use (very intuitive)

-Great customer service: Vendini has an incredible response time to any support request.

-Constantly improving: When we asked for a new feature they added us to a list of people that requested the same feature and not long after we were in the beta testing group.

-Donor information and tracking is robust for small to midsize organizations: We have a small team and we have barely scratched the surface of the donor and patron information",Cons: -Mobile version of the seating chart can be cumbersome and could scale better (I would add that we haven't received any complaints but that is our offices' opinion).,,
"An extremely robust, full-service program for the money. Best we have used.",Kathleen S.,Artistic Director,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jul 18, 2018",4,4,4,5,4,9.0,,Pros: Ease of use. Navigating the Vendini app is relatively simple. There are a variety of ways to find your information. Keeping various patron bases is extremely helpful Being able to look at sales based on single ticket sales or subscriptions is very important. Being able to send marketing emails is a terrific asset.,"Cons: I am not thrilled with the relatively new (appx one year) layout of the events page for a particular event. Have to open multiple windows to get all of the information, such as total sales. In the past, that was all on one screen. The email marketing has improved but would love for it to be even more like a ""constant contact"" program where you could easily import photos and drag and drop various elements. It is challenging to find the right patron lists to include in an eblast.",Overall: Primary benefit is having almost all of our ticket sales/patron base information in one place.,
"Easy install, outstanding customer support, very receptive to suggestion about improvements.",Hans H G.,Managing Director,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jun 27, 2018",5,5,4,5,4,9.0,,"Pros: Very easy to train new box office personnel on the ticketing part, which is essential for a non-profit that relies on part time employees. Backoffice set up, with reporting capabilities and e-mail marketing, gives us all necessary tools to take full advantage of the information collected during hte ticketing process.",Cons: Some aspects of ticketing beyond single ticket sales could be more user friendly. Packages and especially memberships could use some upgrades to improve ease of handling.,,
"Vendini is the Choice When You Need Flexible, Easy-to-Use and Easy-to-Teach Ticketing Software",Lee G.,Event Marketing Manager,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 03, 2017",4,5,4,4,5,9.0,,Pros: The ease of use and the flexibility.,Cons: It gets hung up sometimes and often it is because we need the latest update on a flash player but didn't even know it changed. I wish we had advisories about that.,"Overall: I've been using Vendini ticketing software for eight years and have trained countless numbers of students at my University Box Office how to use the software in a quick amount of time. As our staffing changes each semester, and our events can change on a dime, the ability to train quickly, make changes instantly, and have flexible software that is easy to use, is imperative. I created some great relationships with the Vendini support team so that when there is an occasional hiccup, I know who to call and receive courteous and helpful service. But perhaps the most important aspect of Vendini is that it gets the job done. Not everything has to be complicated, and Vendini isn't!","Recommendations to other buyers: For a box office that has rotating staff that don't have the time to make operating ticketing software their first priority, this is a great option. I can teach someone to use Vendini at the window in five minutes to get us through a busy show. Then, teaching the more intricate levels of reporting, exchanges etc. is easy to build on. I have a student staff of 30 and often many of them change each semester based on their school schedules. Ease of use and success at accomplishing the task are my main priorities and Vendini accomplishes both. It is also affordable!"
Confident all in one ticketing/marketing solution both you and your venue can grow with,Russell T.,Box Office Manager & Event Coordinator,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 23, 2015",5,5,4,5,5,9.0,"Comments: We've been using Vendini since June 2011. One of the major reasons we switched ticketing providers was for ease of use. Our box office is staffed by a rotating group of students who need to be trained in a relatively short period of time. Vendini's POS TicketAgent is pretty self explanatory and my students are able to pick it up almost immediately. On the backend, building events the way we need them is a breeze and it almost seems like the reporting capabilities are limitless. It really makes my job easier by improving the flow of information to our marketing team and development office. As far as peripherals are concerned, Vendini is really ""with it"" in terms of functionality and integration. Our box office was able to upgrade to cash draws that electronically integrate with the POS and we added iPads & iPods so that we could offer print-at-home and mobile tickets. The apps developed to work with these devices are really cool and really easy to use. We get compliments from our customers all the time when we scan their ticket on an iPod or sell them tickets an iPad. I feel really confident knowing that they continue to program new tools and update existing ones to help make event ticketing simpler for venues like mine. What's also really helpful is that they have excellent training and continued learning opportunities through a comprehensive online support catalogue (including both written & video tutorials). It's a great resource. In addition, they host an annual Vendini Member Conference where you can network with system experts and other venues using their solution. It's an invaluable experience to learn more about their solution and how to get the most out of it. In terms of customer service, Vendini has been open to our feedback and responsive to all our requests and has always found a solution for any problems that we have experienced.",,,,
Vendini is Magic!,Allison A.,Administrator,"Music, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,"Aug 08, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: When I came into this job working for a small choral arts group, they had just built their first season with Vendini. I had very little training and had to hit the ground running -- and I was anxious about messing it up. Not only is it incredibly easy to use, but it is really very intuitive and smooth. We have an older patron base who had been used to buying their tickets by mail or personally on the phone; I was concerned that they might not adapt too well. Lo and behold, it is less than a year and online sales account for almost 60% of total sales with almost no complaints. A real tribute!",Cons: This is hard to say. I can't really come up with anything.,"Overall: The most important aspect of working with Vendini has been the support team. To a person, they have been terrifically responsive, patient, and CLEAR in their directions. The patience is amazing!

I don't know where they get their team members, but the selections are superlative. If you are trying to decide between Vendini and another service, go with Vendini.",
Could not manage our theatre without Vendini,Joseph F.,Executive Director,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Dec 13, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: It's easy to learn and quick to teach others. Very intuitive. Love the mobile/ipad apps as well as the Facebook integration and the e-blast capabilities. Easy to reach out for help/customer service.,"Cons: Some of the forms need fixed, some info will go back to blank for no reason. The toggling between admin and sales can lock up the app. Getting the right report to print can be a challenge.",Overall: Vendini literally is the backbone of our business. I can not imagine another way to keep track of our sales and our patrons.,
"Easy to use, always up to date, a great service!",Marnie D.,Theatre Assistant,"Higher Education, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jul 26, 2018",4,5,4,4,4,10.0,,Pros: The convenience and ease of setting up my events. It is no nonsense and easy to change if I make a mistake or need to make a change.,Cons: If Vendini provided the tickets for our Boca printer. It would just be easier if I did not have to contact a separate company for purchasing my tickets.,"Overall: Easy training of my staff, use of credit card for my patrons, ability to set up season ticket packages and ease of using along with social media.",
"Have installed Vendini in several theatres I've administered, all with excellent results",Jon M.,Executive Director,11-50 employees,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jan 02, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: It's intuitive and walks you through virtually everything which makes it very easy to use. New users can be trained in a matter of minutes.,Cons: There are rare glitches which is to be expected but the Tech Support is excellent and usually has a solution/fix quickly.,"Overall: All kinds of reports, easy look-up of orders and patrons, efficient use of time when creating events as the process walks you through it and after creating a couple of events, the process is very easily repeated to set up other events.",
We have worked with Vendini for about 5 years and are pleased with the product and the support.,Jessie P.,Exec Director,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Oct 26, 2017",5,4,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: Having all of our sales and patron data in one place, being able to manage ticket sales, memberships and email communications in one central hub.","Cons: Specific reports we need (for instance, ZIP codes) are difficult to run the way we need to see them. Not being able to import donation data to show up properly into patron record (besides processing the donation through Vendini).",,
Vendini is a simple ticketing solution,Emily S.,Box Office Manager,"Fine Art, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Oct 03, 2016",3,4,4,3,4,7.0,,Pros: It's easy to navigate front end. The patrons rarely had trouble purchasing tickets.,Cons: The financial reporting that did not match.,"Overall: I had worked with Vendini for two years prior to switching to another system. Vendini was fairly simple to use for the customers on the front end, but it became overly complex on the back end due to certain errors in reports and inability to override certain capabilities.",Recommendations to other buyers: It is used best when not dealing with complicated fee structures or discounts.
"Vendini has helped excel our ticket sales, online ticket sales are on the rise with Vendini.",Jill L.,Executive Director,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 15, 2018",5,5,4,5,4,7.0,,"Pros: Ease of use, website interface is seamless with our website. Patrons like having the ability to select their own seat when purchasing through the website. For the business side, the online reports feature is wonderful. Personally my favorite app is Sales Spotlight, it is the absolute greatest thing ever.",Cons: When I type in a patrons name their information doesn't pop up automatically if they have attended before. That extra step of having to search the data base first is cumbersome and has led to many duplicate listings.,,
"I have had the great pleasure of working with Vendini for 5 yrs, I love it!",Shandra L.,Box Office/Front of House Manager,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Oct 06, 2017",5,5,4,5,4,7.0,,"Pros: How user-friendly the software is.

those issues will be resolved.",,

If your lost and don't have a clue they are great with all questions, plus the have a support center that has videos and article to help with anything.",Cons: Only con is against myself.

"Vendini is a reliable, user-friendly, electronic ticketing interface",Cathy S.,Program Admin/Box Office Operations Supervisor,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jun 07, 2017",5,5,5,5,4,7.0,,"Pros: While the software is accessible, it's really the customer support team that is incredible. Over the three years of use, whatever the question or the need to troubleshoot a matter, they are on top of it. Prompt responses are a given. Friendly, capable staffing makes a huge difference for me and all delivered without my need of being an expert. A great product that serves the needs of our theatre patrons online and at the box office, the software provides what is needed for a small venue or larger organization.",,,

It is a ""quick learn"" for my staff and easy-to-use for our guests. If I have any questions, the Vendini staff is quick to respond to my inquiries.",Cons: There is nothing I would change about Vendini.,"Overall: Vendini has been a life-saver for our theatre! They have provided us with excellent customer service for over six years! I would be lost without them. They have helped our theatre grow by allowing us to provide our guests with a professional, easy-to-use, purchasing system. I highly recommend them if you are in the market for a ticket software system!",Recommendations to other buyers: No.
Vendini review,Verified Reviewer,Event & Marketing Manager,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,"Dec 14, 2018",4,4,4,5,5,7.0,,"Pros: The customer service support is great.

I find it quite easy to set up events and email marketing blasts, and our audience members tell me that the ticket purchase process is also very intuitive.","Cons: It's pretty expensive. We are a very small orchestra and the fees take a bite out of our budget, but the less expensive system we used to use lost us customers through frustration, so we are willing to pay the prices to have a system that works.",,
Vendini Ticket Agent has made selling tickets a breeze.,Noel M.,CEO,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 07, 2018",5,4,5,5,5,7.0,,"Pros: Ticket Agent accommodates our small venue theater. Follow the steps and you are selling tickets from a multiple of platforms: laptop, iPhone, computer, and iPad to name a few. You can quickly tab into the show, date, and preferred seats your patron desires without issues. The ability to hold seats, set seats aside (not for sale), and provide handicapped seating through the ticket agent only if that is your preference, are just a few of the simple elements that are completed with only a couple keystrokes.",,Overall: Ticket Agent could only be better if we could select exact seats when selling from a cellular phone. This is one of the great attributes available on computer.,

The BEST reservation/ticketing software !,Michelle D.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,"Mar 03, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: I looked for ten years (no kidding) for the best software for our reservations and ticketing needs. We tried a few during that time frame that just didn't work well enough to suit our needs. I stumbled upon Vendini at an INTIX conference and instantly fell in love. The software has done exactly what I need AND the developers LISTEN to my needs and have actually improved the software based on our requests. They answer the phone when I have problems and FIX it, right away (there has only been a need for this a few times in over 4 years). The additions and features with all the available reports have made my job so much easier. We are more efficient in our marketing efforts (which has saved us a ton of money) due to the reports that tell us where our customers are coming from. The website that is attached to the software makes it a snap to always have the most up to date information on the web for our customers (which in turn has cut down on the number of phone calls from customers because they can easily find that info about us on our website now)

Try it... (I don't work for Vendini)... The day you sign up will be a very happy day. Your job will become so much easier, efficient and FUN. Plus Vendini has Camp Vendini every year where you can go and learn more about the functions of the software, learn about business in general and have some good old fashioned FUN networking with others from the same industry.

I recommend Vendini 100%",,,,

Ticketing events and web features are integrated, yes, but what each function links to and how it will appear live online is often very unclear.

I will admit I have not used a lot of the other ticketing software however this one just seems awkward, unreliable and clunky.","Cons: Many times during checkout, all of the information will disappear and people will need to start over with the order. Other times, guests have reported not being able to be sure they actually had their order processed. From a technical backend perspective, there are just no options. I went to WIX and could design a website much easier with a ticketing option that looked 1000x better. The problem is that the theater company I am helping wants to use this cause it is all they know. There are no templates for website design (which how do you not have this - its 2018 - not 2004??) This just seems like a platform built in the mid 2000s that was never improved upon. The links that were generated for ticketing were not working and the only way to get to the correct page, I needed to create bitly links.. that is just not acceptable.",Overall: I have helped the theater company create events and sell tickets using this system but I do not recommend.,
