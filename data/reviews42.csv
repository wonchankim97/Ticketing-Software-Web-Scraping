tessitura software,"A top-tier ticketing and CRM solution for arts, cultural, and musical venues",Verified Reviewer,nan,"Music, 501-1000 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Jul 22, 2019",5,4,4,5,5,8.0,,"Pros: Tessitura is a mammoth piece of software that has lots of features available for ticketing, fundraising, and marketing. It holds a wealth of constituent data and we can write our own SSRS reports in-house to query this data. Support is amazing, very quick to answer any queries, and very knowledgeable about all aspects of the software. It has been relatively easy to upgrade our software/database version following the very useful documentation found on the Tessitura Network website. The TN website also features webinars, a community forum, and is packed full of information on upcoming networking events.

Tessitura also offer a Tessitura Network Express Web (TNEW) website solution for online bookings which integrates well with the Tessitura software.","Cons: Although the software itself is very customisable with custom plugins and such, it can cause headaches when upgrading to newer versions and has the potential to cause issues - these customisations must be backed up, checked for compatibility, etc. Technical support has originally been handled by agents in the US which had the potential to cause issues with time zones with our organisation being based in the UK, however they have recently restructured their support for Europe and have implemented a new helpdesk system which have helped improve this situation greatly. There are a lot of functions and features that I still feel I've barely touched on as an administrator, as well as there being a steep learning curve for end-users due to the sheer number of features available. UI elements do look a bit dated compared to other solutions on the market.","Overall: Tessitura is the lifeblood of our organisation used by our box office, marketing, and fundraising departments to store all manner of customer information. It is a powerful piece of software with many customisation options that, when configured and utilised correctly, proves a useful tool.",
tessitura software,Industry-standard database for arts & culture,Katie K.,Development Database Manager,"Performing Arts, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Oct 17, 2017",5,3,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: Integrates all departments on the same database. Highly customizable. Integrates with many other common industry systems (mail2, Boca, etc.). Great reporting capabilities. Fantastic support documentation and staff. The user community is unparalleled in skill level, camaraderie, and enthusiasm. Ability to share an instance in a consortium environment, with advanced settings to control who can see what information.",Cons: Steep learning curve - it can be difficult to get beginner users to do much more than search for and look at records. Not the most user-friendly interface. Customizability also means the out of box product can be pretty bare bones compared to everything the software is capable of.,"Overall: Detailed data for informing managerial decisions, increased interdepartmental communication, many facets of constituent knowledge and ways to slice and dice our donorbase",
tessitura software,Designed for larger orgs with data management support,Corinne R.,Membership Manager,"Museums and Institutions, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 22, 2019",4,2,3,5,3,6.0,,"Pros: The record integration is absolutely seamless. I can look up a constituent and see exactly when they came, what donations or purchases they have made, etc. The tech support is robust.","Cons: I have taken a training class in this product, have some experience in coding, and still feel like I only barely understand the basics. It is hard to learn, not intuitive at all, and has more functions than we can currently use at our size (small-mid-size museum) Plus: Expensive!","Overall: It has been hard to learn, and I frankly still don't feel confident pulling lists that my data is correct. I appreciate it's enormous capacity on the back end, but there's not a lot of front-end user options.",
tessitura software,A beast of a product,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Music, 501-1000 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Jun 25, 2019",4,3,4,4,4,8.0,,"Pros: It is so customisable, and does so much. There are facets for all areas of our organisation.","Cons: It is so customisable. This is an amazing feature, but comes with a lot of pitfalls and makes life challenging at upgrade time.","Overall: Tessitura is at the heart of everything we do as an organisation. It holds our customer data, we use it to manage our ticketing and website offerings, to manage Direct Debits and donations, marketing, and much more. We could not function without it.",
tessitura software,I used Tessi in my time at a nationally-renowned Symphony orchestra.,Brian G.,Membership Coordinator,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"May 25, 2018",5,4,4,5,3,8.0,,"Pros: I find that Tessi is very intuitive and use-oriented. When I started with it, I was obviously overwhelmed, but that was tempered by it's relative ease of use, and the vast online resources available for questions that did arise.","Cons: Having used both Tessi and RE, I will say that one is much better for Box Office organizations (Tessi) than it is at housing constituent info, giving history, and basic fundraising needs. RE has robust capability for storing/targeting/querying on/exporting etc. much more so than RE.","Overall: Ease of ticketing, seating, and viewing the house. I enjoyed the option to charge directly each purchase, as opposed to batching gifts individually like I did in RE.",
tessitura software,Essential ticketing software for Arts venues,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Music, 201-500 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Apr 13, 2018",4,4,5,5,4,8.0,,Pros: Company fully understands the requirements of the industry that it is targeting. There is an excellent community with end users willing to engage and help each other.,Cons: Requires quite a lot of resource to manage and maintain in terms of staff and hardware. Would hope to see this improve in coming releases and perhaps a shift to a cloud implementation.,Overall: Runs the entire CRM and ticketing solution for the organisation.,
tessitura software,Tessitura and Fund Raising,Jon G.,Owner,"Philanthropy, Self-employed",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Apr 19, 2018",2,1,2,2,2,5.0,Comments: Shop around. There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,"Pros: The integration of ticketing with prospects/donors is alluring, esp. for performance art organizations.","Cons: This is a ticketing software with a CRM work-around built in. It's confusing, user abusive and extraordinarily expensive. In our town, NPO's had to group together, in one building, where they created a new company that specializes in Tessitura software management. It's a clever use of the software and a business structure. This company then went out and sold it's software services to other performance art organizations as far away as Los Angeles. However, all organizations can see who has who in their database. You can't go into the account, but it becomes readily apparent our prospects and donors are being hit on all the time by all the same organizations. It's tricky. But the fact remains. Tessitura is enormously complex, just to get acknowledgements out is a lot of busy work. When I came on board, the previous development person really used Tessitura as a storage unit and did all the fund raising in Excel and Word. And from a NPO business perspective, once you commit to this software, extraction is basically a blackmail. It costs a fortune to leave it and organizations still have this challenge of ticketing tied to fund raising.",Overall: Runs the entire CRM and ticketing solution for the organisation.,
tessitura software,Great Arts CRM,Siobhan P.,Tessitura Administrator,"Fine Art, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,nan,Source: Software Advice,"Jul 12, 2017",4,4,4,5,4,9.0,Comments: Shop around. There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,Pros: Windows based Easy to use Great support All in one package Customisable Based on SQL Server Reports can be designed in house,Cons: Old reports are based on Sybase's Infomaker which is a hard product to purchase. Newer reports are based on SSRS so you will need training for this.,Overall: Runs the entire CRM and ticketing solution for the organisation.,
tessitura software,Great,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 51-200 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Aug 15, 2018",5,3,4,5,5,10.0,Comments: Shop around. There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,Pros: Tessitura is definitely the most popular in the nonprofit arts industry. It's ticketing and fundraising features are integrated and allows for a full constituent report.,"Cons: Lately, the software seems outdated. Unlike Raiser's Edge, Tessitura demands a full training to know the ins and outs of the software. It's not the most user-friendly software out there.",Overall: Runs the entire CRM and ticketing solution for the organisation.,
tessitura software,Could be better,Grace B.,Piano Faculty,"Music, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Oct 21, 2018",3,1,3,nan,nan,4.0,Comments: Shop around. There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,"Pros: This software has a lot of muscle power, no doubt about it. There is a lot of functionality, and every problem you come across when it comes to how to send tickets out, sending receipts to patrons, etc has a solution","Cons: 1) This software is WAY too complicated for the average theater. The learning curve is very steep, which complicates the hiring process for temporary employees (cause they never get to the point of mastery and efficiency with the software), and there is no way to edit out which functions to ""see"" on your screen. For example, if xyz theater never uses a third of the functions of the software, there should be a way to visually hide them so that employees dont get confused about what they are seeing on the screen.

2) When it comes to entering information for credit card payments, the software designers never apparently thought about how the average patron reads out their information over the phone. You have to select the type of card used before entering the card number, meanwhile the patron is halfway through spewing out their number over the phone while the ticketing office employee is scrambling to write it down on a pad of paper cause Tessie wont let them enter the number yet. If there was more flexibility in the order that information could be entered (card type then number vs number then card type), the daily functionality of the software would be much improved.",Overall: Runs the entire CRM and ticketing solution for the organisation.,
tessitura software,Tessitura review,Andrea H.,Owner and designer,"Arts and Crafts, Self-employed",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 27, 2018",5,5,5,5,4,9.0,Comments: Shop around. There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,Pros: I recently started using tessitura and I like the simplicity of it. I am able to easily view the events and see how many seats are available for what date.,"Cons: Only con I have is for the saving button, it says ""done"" instead of ""save"". It sometimes confuses me when I'm closing an order.",Overall: Overall I like the program. It has everything I need to get my work done and easily see what we need to sell the following day.,
tessitura software,I've been using Tessitura for a few months and I enjoy the ability to learn new functions every day.,Verified Reviewer,nan,,Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Jan 09, 2018",5,4,5,3,nan,nan,Comments: Shop around. There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,Pros: There are so many functions to learn about this software that I always am excited to learn. Tessitura gives you so much information so many forms that it's insane on what this software can hold.,Cons: It is a bit complicated and you do need a specialist if you want to really learn how to fully utilize the software.,Overall: Overall I like the program. It has everything I need to get my work done and easily see what we need to sell the following day.,
tessitura software,Great intent difficult to learn,Cameron M.,Box Office Lead,"Events Services, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 11, 2019",3,2,4,3,nan,4.0,Comments: Shop around. There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,Pros: Tessitura has a lot of good ticketing features. It has a great ability to customize and tracks data way better than SABO. The best part of this software is when it comes to selling subscriptions. It is really easy and user intuitive when it comes to this feature.,Cons: This software is really difficult to learn and train others on. The UI is confusing and it is difficult to find what you are looking for. The worst part of this software is how easy it is to give an order to a different patron. there are no warning signs and this has been a common problem around the office.,Overall: Overall I have not been happy with Tessitura. I feel it is far harder to use than helpful. The features it offers are great but it does not make it worth the investment.,
tessitura software,Art Organization Zeus,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Writing and Editing, Self-employed",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"May 31, 2019",5,4,4,nan,nan,7.0,Comments: Shop around. There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,"Pros: For donor organization, easy and effective with a wide range of tracking.","Cons: Ugh, ok, repeat entries were the scourge of my job. So its effectiveness definitely depends on the team who uses it. I wish there were an option for Tessitura to regularly compare possible multiple entries to combine.","Overall: Every arts organization uses Tessitura for a reason. All encompassing, it's reach is impressive, limited only by its users organization.",
tessitura software,An incredibly robust ticketing and seating software,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Performing Arts, 51-200 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Oct 04, 2017",4,3,4,5,4,8.0,Comments: Shop around. There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,Pros: Tessitura allows you to input and seat based on your own theater's house model. I like that there's a visual layout you can view to see which seats are taken and what kind of ticket they're purchased under.,Cons: Tessitura is a large and complicated software. I'm not even aware of all of the things it can do. It's a true learning process and companies may choose how deep down the rabbit hole they'd like to go: using it lightly or going so far as to send members of their theater to the huge Tessitura conference once a year.,"Overall: Every arts organization uses Tessitura for a reason. All encompassing, it's reach is impressive, limited only by its users organization.",
tessitura software,Tessitura is an easy to use fundraising and ticketing software system that I would reccomend,Verified Reviewer,nan,"Performing Arts, 51-200 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,nan,"Feb 01, 2018",3,3,4,2,4,7.0,Comments: Shop around. There has to be a more efficient and effective product.,Pros: Ease of use in the ticketing function. One is able to see and use a seat map in real time to place and track orders. These orders are then linked to the constituents account where you can track the moves management of a particular donor and see their giving history.,Cons: Does not have the full capacity of moves management as seen in Raiser's Edge NXT but has a better ticketing and box office functionality. A better database for those who own their own performance venue and have a larger marketing than development team. Not ideal for someone who is focused on development first.,"Overall: Every arts organization uses Tessitura for a reason. All encompassing, it's reach is impressive, limited only by its users organization.",
