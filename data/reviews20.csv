Great Customer Service,Felicia B.,Owner,"Restaurants, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VR,Source: Capterra,"Jan 26, 2017",4,3,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: With nothing to compare it to, not sure I can give a fair evaluation on software.","Cons: Redundancies. Too many steps. At this point, with the number of events I have created, it should take less than 5 minutes to set up.

Loading images and getting them to the right size, resolution and added steps to update everytime you make change.

Recommendation would be to allow companies to set up a template and only have to fill in changes to the actual event OR fix Cloning. Whenever I use the Cloning feature, there is always issues that don't make sense.","Overall: We are a smaller venue and on-line ticket sales are primarily a convenience for customers within the local area. In my opinion, the overall function and ease of use, could be more streamlined to reduce some of the reduncancy when creating an event. I would consider myself above average on a technical level, but there seems to be tedious issues, requiring me to ask for assistance whenever I am creating an event. Having said that, the support we receive from Gary Bradshaw and his quick response at resolving any problems, is excellent. We have not tried other ticketing agencies because of the level of customer service we receive.

To be fair, I have never used another ticketing agent, so I have nothing to compare it to. The reason for 3 Star on Ease of Use is because, while not complicated, it can be tedious and more time consuming than I believe it should.

Having been in business for a long time, even if a particular product or service is slightly higher in cost or slightly lower in quality, it is well worth it when customer service is above reproach.",
Andrew Peterson presents Behold The Lamb Of God,Lisa S.,Event Coordinator,"Religious Institutions, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,VR,Source: Capterra,"Dec 12, 2016",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Very user-friendly - Very detailed - Lots of helpful reports including the profit and loss statement!,"Cons: Just the one glitch we had with 8-10 tickets having only the first name on attendees ticket and 2 first names on our attendee list instead of first and last name. For example, instead of Keri Johnson, it had Keri Keri.","Overall: My overall experience with Attendstar was very positive! Customer service was outstanding! They're very helpful in answering questions, adding tickets, verifying ticket refunds, etc... They were awesome from start to finish!

The afternoon of the concert, I printed out our list of attendees to give to those checking in our guests at the front door. The only glitch we had, there were 8-10 ticket holders that when they presented their tickets, it only had their first name. So we asked for their last name, thinking it was probably just a printing area, but the last name was still not on the attendee list. What we soon figured out was with these 8-10 tickets, was their first name was on the attendee list as both their first and last names. For example, Ticket holder #125, order ID 1419943, was listed on the attendee list as Keri Keri. This was not a huge detriment of anything but I just wanted to let you know so you could look into it from your end. We would definitely use Attendstar again!!! Thanks, Attendstar!!!",

There are more functions and features that have been added than I've taken advantage of -- but I feel that I've gotten plenty with what has long been a part of the package.,"Cons: There isn't much not to like. I suppose it'd be nice to be able to copy events or tickets a bit easier, but that's a minor issue.","Overall: We've used AttendStar for multiple events. The software/web UI is easy to navigate and it doesn't take long to master. The feature set continues to improve, and it's clear that the company is continually looking for ways to enhance their product. From my perspective, though, the biggest selling point for AttendStar is how they service their product and value their customers. They are responsive, friendly, thoughtful and you feel like you've got an ally in them -- even though they are filling a particular need, it's clear they want the entire event to be successful. We highly recommend them and mention them to other entertainers and event planners!",

I love how they can track the sales and give you up to date tickets sales. The staff is wonderful they have assisted me, even when I didn't know I needed it!","Cons: Not too many cons. If I had to pick one, they used to provide hard tickets for the price of shipping only. I miss that.","Overall: For 3 years I have been using Attendstar. Their service is amazing! I have used them quite often and now that I travel the country interacting with other promoters, I am constantly steering them to Attendstar!

I have used others and they are far behind when it comes to value and service!",

Five Star Rating For AttendStar,Janice S.,,,,VR,Source: Capterra,"Jan 27, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: My dealings with AttendStar was a FIVE STAR experience.

This was my first time using an online ticket service, but after talking with the AttendStar agents I was confident I chose the right people. The agents took the time to answer all of my many questions with professionalism, were knowledgeable about the service, and very people-friendly.

They had me set up for business in no time. My customers found it to be a easy convenient way to purchase tickets to my event. I also had 24/7 access to my account to review and keep track of all my transactions.
