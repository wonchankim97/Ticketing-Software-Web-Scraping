"Outstanding software, support, development and value",Jamie C.,,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 28, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,Comments: Three to four years ago while searching online for ticketing solutions the options that were available were very limited. Choosing a solution for an entire season of concerts is a big step. osConcert was affordable but more importantly provides so much flexibility. I had very specific needs. Integration with Stripe and/or Square was necessary and it was implemented. Integration with Infusionsoft was crucial and it was implemented. The way I needed osConcert to present and deliver information as it related to infusionsoft was unique and it was implemented. osConcert and its developers are smart and understand what you want. The turnaround time is amazing and the development costs are incredibly affordable.,,,,

The system works well in browsers on all devices, and there are regular feature improvements. Our patrons love the ability to select their own seats, pick appropriate discounts, and pay in their preferred method. There is a cost for some of the upgrades over the years, but it is minimal. The upgrade and support costs are well worth the ability to control your own box office site without paying a per-ticket fee.","Recommendations to other buyers: We did a lot of research, and we check again almost annually, but this system is the best on the market if you need reserved seat selection and don't want to pay a commission per ticket."

The learning curve is pretty large. If you are proficient in PhP, then you'll do fine. The sql relationship chart is unavailable and the number of tables in astounding, so sql solutions are a pain.",

I have talked to many of our customers and have received many positive comments. The seating plan set up and look is the first thing that attracts people and it is easy to use for the average computer user. It is also easy to set up for a booking agent who can then sell hard copy tickets directly to the public. If I have one small negative comment it is the ticket printing which many people seem to struggle with so perhaps this could be looked at in the future. All of the background information storage is easy to access and making changes to the seating and editing is simple. The customer support from Gordon has been exceptional from the early days of my learning about the software right up to today and email responses are very quick when a problem needs to be solved.

Finally I would like to say I highly recommend osconcert to all businesses looking for value for money ticketing software.",Recommendations to other buyers: If you are looking for value for money ticketing software then look no further.
