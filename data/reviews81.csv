coconut tickets,Simple and Easy to use Ticketing Solution,Stephen W.,Director,"Events Services, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Dec 22, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Coconut Tickets, is one of the best ticketing systems on the market, it professes to have been developed by Event Organisers for Event Organisers and I suspect that is correct. The developers have thought of just about everything this we as an event company could need from ticketing solution. It is versatile and easy to interrogate to get information when needed. The scanning API works well (dependent on your location)all in all a good all round ticketing tool.","Cons: There are very few things that we dislike about the system. What we have noticed is that the developer listens to the end user and therefore the system is still to a small extend 'Work in Progress'

Page functionality (tabbing forwards and backwards) we know is being looked at.

To be honest, there is very little to dislike about Coconut tickets","Overall: If anything Coconut has helped resolve problems rather than creating any. Our previous ticketing solution that was used for an Ice Rink was cumbersome and difficult to add customer to with Telephone sales, with Coconut it is easy, and through conversation with the developer we know there are still more (very minor) improvements going to be made in this specific area.",
coconut tickets,Coconut Tickets Vender Pitches Review,Alex M.,Event & Business Development Manager,"Events Services, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Dec 19, 2018",4,4,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: I started using Coconut Tickets' vendor pitch feature to sell trader pitches & stalls at my events/festivals. We were using word document application forms before and manually inputting data. I had been looking for an online solution for quite a while when Coconut Tickets got in touch. Their vendor pitch feature is exactly what I was looking for and I can do everything in one place - applications, document uploads, email templates and payments. I haven't found another solution out there that does exactly what I need. Their customer service is also absolutely amazing - very fast response, quick bug fixing and even making improvements based on my suggestions.","Cons: As Coconut Tickets vendor pitches is a fairly new feature there have been a few bugs and teething problems along the way. However, as I explained above, their customer service has been amazing and all issues have been fixed very quickly. I have almost been a guinea pig as this feature has developed and have offered suggestions of improvement, which have been taken on board massively. Certain tools can sometimes be a little difficult to understand at first, but i would definitely stick with it, ask for help, and it will solve all your trader applications needs!","Overall: Coconut Tickets has helped us transfer our trader/vendor process from a manual, time consuming task to a an easier and much faster process. Traders can fill in an online application form, submit their bids/choose their pitches, upload all H&S documents and agree to our T&Cs. All this info is stored within my CC profile and I can also export all information as an excel spreadsheet as well as download all documents. There a number of different pitch sales formats available that suit all our needs and as I said above, the customer service is wonderful!",
