zaui software,My Review,Nadine D.,Operations,"Leisure, Travel & Tourism, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Apr 03, 2019",4,4,3,3,4,7.0,,"Pros: - Activities and packages fairly easy to build and get up and running

- I love the ability to connect with other systems and the OTAs

- I appreciate the help from reps. They are efficient, professional and knowledgeable. If they're not sure about an answer, they check before stating it as true. Other support staff has not been as helpful.","Cons: - Reliability - It seems that with every fix that is released, one issue is solved but then another problem occurs or key functions are removed.

- Slow loading

- Need the ability to custom design the manifests

- Communication - I wish there was more communication as to when updates are released and what the update includes.

- It can be very time consuming to get stuff completed. I.e. removing bar codes from our system, updating the training website to match the live site, etc...

- The email/SMS notifications should be an easier process. Creating and editing them is difficult and time-consuming. They are a great feature but need to be more user-friendly.

- We have created so many workarounds for our charters department. It is not a usable system for our charters division without these workarounds.

- Not having the ability to edit some of the hard-coded wording on our website along with the receipt portion that guests receive when printing their tickets.

- Need the ability to archive old stuff like employees, agents, activities, etc...

- Need the ability to put date bands around everything. It's frustrating to have to link and unlink activities depending on availability.

- Reports not being the correct i.e. report by agent, summary by activity

- The reports available for accounting purposes are not detailed enough or contain so much additional, unneeded information that manipulating the report isn't any faster than the other system we have in place.",,
zaui software,Zaui helped Copper Cayuse Outfitters build a better business,Don C.,Owner,"Leisure, Travel & Tourism, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Apr 16, 2019",5,5,5,5,4,10.0,,Pros: Zaui is easy to use and set up was easy with the support provided. We were up and running with a few days and were quickly able to use the software to stream line our business. Zaui was able to quickly customize parts of their program to fit our business.Our business doubled in the first year of operation with Zaui and grew by 40% in the second year and we expect continued growth in future years. Zaui integrated into our website seamlessly to provide an easy shopping experience for our customers.,"Cons: Integration into our financial system has been a bit of a challenge, but now seems to work fine. More comparative reports from one year to the next would be helpful.","Overall: We did a deep dive on about four booking platforms before we made the decision to go with Zaui. As an operation we were ham strung with phone calls and had a great deal of difficulties keeping track of bookings and taking payments. During my search I found that most of the booking platform offered essential the same features. The difference was location and the level of personalized service. Zaui solved most of our operational sales, booking and payment issues and allows us to concentrate on our operations offering the best in horse back riding experiences.",
zaui software,Zaui is truly the Foundation of our Shuttle Business,Jillian W.,Owner / Marketing Manager,"Leisure, Travel & Tourism, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Apr 02, 2019",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Our company took over an Airport Shuttle operation and we had only a few weeks to get the new shuttle routes up and running. representative teams have been incredible in supporting our business, teaching us to better use the software and answer our many, MANY questions along the way. The Point to Point software give our owners, drivers and clients complete confidence in our shuttle service. Zaui has absolutely been the foundation of our shuttle business.",Cons: There are some features that we are still hoping for (and understand that the developers are looking into these) such as allowing our guests & agents to modify and cancel their own bookings and having agents create bookings without needing to input payment information.,"Overall: I would not know how to operate our shuttle service without Zaui! The ease of use, live manifests, and support has been incredible. I would (and have!) recommended Zaui Software to any shuttle company, tour company or transportation company that is looking to sell their services online, better organize their staff and ultimately run a smoother operation.",

The software is relatively easy to use.,"Cons: If you are looking for a reservation software/platform that experiences frequent outages that can last for 24 hours during peak tourism season, this software is for you. They have literally lost their clients thousands of dollars due to their reliability issues. Unfortunately, our clients only sees your website and this flawed product will directly impact your reputation. Until they fundamentally improve their reliability and work with their third party infrastructure providers (Microsoft Azure), I can not recommend this company/product. Unfortunately it is very difficult to change providers halfway through peak season, otherwise I would have!","Overall: It started off being a good software and I enjoyed the professional help from their technical team.
