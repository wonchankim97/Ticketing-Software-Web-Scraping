syam software,SyAM one stop for all!,Pamela M.,Director of Technology,"Education Management, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 15, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: By using the SyAM applications - it has reduced the time in so many different ways. Making the daily work load so much less than it was.

We use SyAM for asset management , one benefit is that is has taken away the task of touching each machine to grab the mac address for MAC authentication. We just run a report and grab it from the SyAM asset management application. It also helps us with our yearly inventory report that needs to be presented to the BOE.

We use SyAM for our MDM - by using SyAM we touch the machines once when they come in and then we never see them again unless the screen breaks.

We use SyAM for our ticketing system. We had a reduction in staff this year and the ticketing system has been amazing. When a ticket is created - it is sent out to the techs and they are able to respond in a reasonable time, making everyone happy. I am so glad we have this system.

The support from SyAM is fantastic. I have never been disappointed.",Cons: I would like to clean up the ticketing system so it flows better for the end user. I am pretty sure this is on my end not SyAM. I can't really think of anything that we do not like about the software.,Overall: It has been exceptional!,
syam software,SyAM Software,Lauren R.,Helpdesk Coordinator,"Primary/Secondary Education, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 09, 2019",4,5,4,5,5,9.0,,Pros: We have tried many helpdesk/MDM/inventory systems and this one is very intuitive to learn. The customization level is decent and the support from the company staff has been amazing. Someone is always a phone call away and willing to explain or remote into the system. Their support documentation is also very detailed which makes it easy to follow along with steps to something you are unfamiliar with.,"Cons: The cons that I have about this software seem to all be items SyAM is working on, which is nice. The MDM system currently does not allow assignment based on ID's like some other systems. Currently the helpdesk system is not integrated with Google SSO sign in for our organization, which does not allow us to use the helpdesk end-user portal. In the future they say this will be possible and we are very much looking forward to it!","Overall: SyAM has been a good solution for us this last year. We were looking for a system which could help us eliminate multiple vendors and costs for MDM, inventory, helpdesk, power management and software installs. We are actively working with SyAM to discuss desired features and adjustments to the system and are thankful they are willing to be part of the conversation.",

Also, the built-in remote support tool is phenomenal.",Cons: The utilitarian appearance and slight learning curve to using the Management Utility,"Overall: I worked with Syam at a previous job.

Additionally, it provides me the necessary alerting when I have server issues.",
