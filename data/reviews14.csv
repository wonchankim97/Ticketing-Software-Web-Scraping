"Great for traditional theaters, not versatile enough for ad-hoc performances",Carey H.,Business Director,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 03, 2019",4,3,3,4,3,7.0,,"Pros: The interface is generally easy to navigate and figure out on your own. There are so many useful features, it can feel a bit cluttered, but once one learns the process, it handles every aspect of selling. The API is nice for embedding on your own site.","Cons: The entire process - from setup to event management to the API - is centered around multiple performances of one run (show), as per a traditional theater. Setting up one-off shows and shows that run continuously is much more of a burden to maintain. Ad-hoc shows, especially, require that you set up a completely new event, including reminder emails, ticket setup, etc. even if that info doesn't change from show to show.","Overall: The system is reliable and solid in what it does. Support does their best to help you find workarounds for non-traditional theaters, but are unwilling to consider enhancement requests without paying for the development. My one actual technical issue (notifications of credit card failure self-dismissed to quickly for the user to read) has been pretty much ignored.",
VBO makes our ticketing accessible to all,Lynn V.,Board member,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 04, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: VBO has the best support and most flexible solution to meet all of our ticketing and registration needs. After evaluating numerous Solutions, but ease-of-use during set up all the way through the user experience has been a game changer for us. We went from selling 80% of our tickets In person or at the door to selling 95% of our tickets online. This helps us forecast revenue, understand the number of volunteers we will need at events, And communicate easily with our ticket buyers before and after events. Our ticket sales have increased dramatically over the past two years","Cons: After selling well over 30,000 tickets a year the number of complaints from users or ticket buyers have been able to be counted on two hands. Usually the complaint is that they don't know how to scroll down to put the tickets in the cart. That has literally been the only complaint and it happened about 10 times.","Overall: We aren't entirely volunteer Ronn community theater organization. Our board, members, and patrons range in age from five years old to 90 years old. Our biggest fear was having our retired Ticket ladies be able to understand the software and still sell tickets, and our customers being able to transition to an online sale. We have had A fantastic experience with this transition and it has only become easier for us to bring our shows to the community.",
Powerful but sometimes confusing; lots of upkeep for optimal use,Chris Crotty C.,General Manager/Owner,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 02, 2017",5,3,5,4,4,8.0,,"Pros: VBO offers a lot of features and options. Plus the company is willing (or used to be) to develop new features if you make a strong case. Ease of integration with existing sites is fairly easy. Customer support is generally quick, responsive, and thorough. The platform has never gone down in our many year use, so it's definitely stable.","Cons: The interface can be confusing at times. Also, the software glitches at times when using the Box Office function, e.g., asking for full account info when you don't want to add all fields. Usually logging out and in fixes the problem. Another minor complaint: when you copy and event, it won't automatically update the ""end sale"" by the relative date; you have to set it manually.",Overall: Runs ticketing and merchandise sales for my theater.,
A Symphony of value,Paul I.,Executive Director,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 04, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: We were looking for an affordable, clean, cloud-based ticketing solution. We needed to be able to let our patrons choose specific reserve seating and also enable staff to manage box office and season subscriptions. I especially like the fact that cost is entirely transactional with no upfront fees, no annual subscription or added training costs or support costs. I've also been happily surprised with the outstanding online and phone support.","Cons: Onboarding was a bit difficult as there was limited formal training. However, the online tutorials are good and online/phone support is exceptional.",Overall: Our experience with VBO has been outstanding!,
"Easy to use, robust and affordable",Peter H.,Box Office Manager,"Performing Arts, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 14, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: This a very robust system which allows us to manage ticket and subscriptions as well as class registrations in one single platform. VBO is very cost effective given the numerous features it offers. Our organization produces 10 productions annually, as well as dozens of classes, and our summer camp program, all of which we sell through VBO.",,,,
VBO Tickets - A Complete Solution,Tyrone R.,Director,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 23, 2017",5,4,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Robust features and functionality that covers many needs/requirements of today and some that may be needed in the future,Cons: A little difficult to navigate,"Overall: CaribTix has special needs from ticket printing and online ticket sales, to mobile apps and ticket validation... The team at VBO has responded to ALL requests. One example: Several CaribTix clients use physical thermal tickets so we offer the service in addition to online ticketing, VBO was able to facilitate the import of printed thermal tickets so both physical and online tickets reside in the same database. Additionally, VBO was able to design an app to facilitate the sales, statistics and validation of all tickets online or offline. This has allowed us to provide a Closed Loop Solution for our clients.",Recommendations to other buyers: Design a simpler UI
Terrific support,Dorothy B.,Treasurer,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 22, 2019",5,4,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: VBO created custom programs for us at no extra cost and were super responsive all along the way in our transition. It manages much more than just ticket sales - our membership program with four levels, comp tickets for our cast and crew, merchandise sales, discount prices for our members, emails to members when their memberships are going to expire and lots more.","Cons: It is fairly expensive, but we have the cost added to the ticket prices as a fee. Most buyers are used to such fees and do not complain. It is fairly complex, so it is difficult to keep our box office volunteers trained to use all its functions.","Overall: Ticket sales are a breeze. We are able to track memberships easily and without error, which is huge.",
Wonderful support. Indispensable tool.,Franco I.,Artistic Director,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 06, 2016",4,4,4,5,4,10.0,,Pros: Support: Extremely responsive to the customer needs.,Cons: Even though it was not originally designed for class registrations we've used VBO for this. There are some things that our staff would like to see to help make things easier so it's up to us to let VBO know.,"Overall: We use VBO for almost all our class registrations as well as our home season ticketed concert. The support team has been supporting us from the very beginning:

- Listening and implementing our suggestions to make the tool work for our needs.

- Always available when we need to reach them.

- Their overall passion for serving the arts community and making their product better.",Recommendations to other buyers: We can't recommend them enough for other organizations that are looking for a convenient and affordable way to enhance and simplify their box office needs.
New box office,Brian L.,Fine Arts Director,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 16, 2016",5,5,3,5,5,10.0,,Pros: customer service. On line and hand held user friendliness.,Cons: The report structure. We need to be able to report in a more direct fashion instead of making due.,"Overall: We recently switched to VBO following an extended agreement with a different box office software company. The customer service features of VBO are unsurpassed. We are thrilled with the experience we are able to offer our patrons. What we are having issues with currently is the promise of a report that will help with all of our needs. We, or course, understand that all things take time and that everything good is worth waiting for. Unfortunately, we have had to make due with a hunt and peck method of reporting to both our business office and and marketing department for sales data. It is there, but it is currently far from user friendly. The staff at VBO continues to be extremely helpful in helping us find solutions to our problems, but it is not the panacea that we were hoping for. Perhaps a Christmas present of the new report is on the horizon so that the internal users can also experience the expediency that our patrons are witnessing. I still strongly recommend VBO to anyone who is interested in a box office system. I will give it an even stronger recommendation once the new report is available. Keep going, guys! The finish line must be close.",
"Best ticketing partner, ever",John D.,Operations Director,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 14, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Flexibility, complete feature set, sophisticated integration, ongoing product improvements, such as reporting and CRM","Cons: There are some rough edges as you dig behind the scenes, but things get better month after month.","Overall: Having used other ticketing services, VBO has been a strategic partner with Tabard in every sense. We have grown with them as they have continually improved the quality and functionality of software over the years. What truly stands out is their attention to personal service and making sure that things work correctly for the client, and that the client knows how to best use their immensely capable platform. I couldn't be happier with VBO.","Recommendations to other buyers: You can save yourself a lot of trouble and expense by going with VBO, compared with other full-featured ticketing platforms."
VBO is the BEST!!,Chris K.,Customer Relations Manager,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 28, 2016",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Customer Service

Their customer base is small so they spend time with every customer creating a customized approach to ticketing.","Recommendations to other buyers: This software is easy to use. Everything you need is all in this system. With the new mobile app, desktop and cloud services, this is an awesome product!"
Powerful and Flexible,Achmed Rauff A.,Executive Director,"Information Technology and Services, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 11, 2019",5,4,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: It's immense features that enables new ways to create sales and promotions.

Fits almost all types of events at any scale.","Cons: There is a learning curve that requires sufficient training and familiarity.

Due to the sheer number of features it is easy to get overwhelmed.

A stronger build it email blast for CRM would be good to have instead on relying on 3rd party integration.","Overall: Go to market times are faster once familiar.

Support is thus far is good but we are really hoping that response times would be better.",
A Boon For Patrons and Marketers,Amy R.,Head of Marketing,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 14, 2017",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Ease of use. Availability of information that's most important to me as a marketer.,"Cons: I'd like to see more videos that show me how to use the system in more advanced ways than I think of on my own. I do appreciate their available videos, however.","Overall: Yea and Bravo! As the marketer in our organization, I love how easy VBO tickets is for our patrons, how seamless the experience is, how easy it is for me to integrate the VBO patron information into our marketing, and how responsive the VBO team is when I have questions.","Recommendations to other buyers: I like the software so much, that when I go to an event and I see an organization uses it, I think more highly of the organization."
Farimont Opera House Review,Katrina S.,Administrative Assistant,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 03, 2019",5,5,5,5,4,9.0,,"Pros: I like that we have the ability to use an online ticketing system, it has made our work so much easier.","Cons: Sometimes when I have selected tickets and I go to apply the customer to the tickets, it essentially locks the tickets and we have to go reclaim them one by one, which can be time consuming if they are buying multiple tickets.",Overall: We are saving time and giving the customers a chance to go online to purchase tickets themselves. Before it was call/ stop in only and recorded on paper.,
"Best value ticketing software, amazing management",Christian P.,Director of Operations,"Performing Arts, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 14, 2017",4,4,4,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Customizability,,"Overall: VBO Tickets has been a great partner. Senior staff is unwaveringly willing to make changes to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their product. The software has grown by leaps and bounds since it's inception and Management continues to improve the product on an almost daily basis. The reporting function could be more robust and customizable, but if I know VBO, upgrades are probably already in the works. I consistently receive ticketing system demos to keep my options open, and truly believe that there isn't another product on the market that even comes close to what VBO offers, at this price point.",
San Francisco Playhouse loves VBO.,TIiu R.,Patron Services Manager,"Fine Art, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 14, 2017",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Responsive, quick, user-friendly","Cons: updates sometimes come with no warning, Salesforce integration has been troublesome for our development team","Overall: Customer support representatives are very responsive, and if what I need isn't possible in the system, they will build it for me. It's a powerful CRM that's user-friendly, my favorite ticketing system I've used so far (I'm familiar with 3 including Tessitura.) We've been trying to integrate it with salesforce, which has been a bit of a bother, but that's not my department!",Recommendations to other buyers: Keep up the good work and keep making my life easier!
Great for Superior Control,Josiah F.,,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 15, 2017",5,4,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: After looking at a lot of different ticket agents we found VBO tended to be comparable price (even on the less expensive end of the spectrum) and offer the best range of control over what we can do. The best part about this company however is that if there is ever something that we needed that is not already integrated into the system their fantastic customer service agents immediately get to work getting it to work for us. The only concern that I have with them is that because of all the control that they give to us it has taken a long time to get it to work the way we want it. Overall though, fantastic!",,,,
Very Satisfied Community Theater User,Theresa D.,Director/Producer,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 10, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: The user friendliness is what I value most about VBO. It is extremely easy to use and to problem solve with. There are different levels of functionality so some people may use it minimally while others in your organization can learn the more in-debt features.,Cons: Some of the event setup seams redundant. I wish there was a better way to copy one event into the next.,"Overall: It has completely changed how we do business. Our system was extremely manual and now everything is automated. In addition to using it for tickets, we use it for camp registrations as well as audition registrations. This has simplified our internal processes greatly.",
Reliable and Flexible,Donny G.,Marketing Director,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 06, 2016",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Flexibility, ease of use, customer service.",Cons: Learning curve.,"Overall: As a mid-sized nonprofit theatre, VBO's services have been invaluable to us. The front-end ticketing experience is second-to-none, and we've been able to customize it to fit our needs perfectly. With our old ticketing platform, customers had to leave our website to buy tickets -- now, it's a seamless experience.",

Fantastic Customer Support for a Fantastic Product,Ben G.,Business Development Coordinator,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 06, 2016",5,4,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Ease of use, and functionality",Cons: I think the UI could be a little more friendly to new users. Could be more intuitive.,"Overall: I've been using VBO for over three years now and I cannot express how fantastic a program it is.

Multiple times I've called support with a question about how to do something obscure and gotten a response of ""Oh, you can't do that... but give me a few hours"" and before the end of the day, they have programmed in new functionality to meet my request. A+",

From a patron perspective, it is clean and easy to use - this hasn't always been the case with other ticketing software. The donation piece of the software has always been good, but has even improved during our tenure.",
VBO is an Excellent Tool!,Jekeva P.,Marketing and Facilities Manager,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 21, 2016",4,4,3,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: the discounting system is great, it was really easy to create special deals. The ability to add marketing into the receipt was good.",Cons: It is not a one-stop site. Things like creating a birthday club for our fans was extremely difficult. Newsletter features were very nil.,"Overall: If you are not computer savvy, learning VBO can be a bit daunting, but the customer service team is excellent. Each time I call them with a question, I talk to a real person who is helpful and kind. VBO is really good for tracking information and allows you to alter your ticketing info and events with ease. The mailing system for customers is OK, but they work well with other institutions such as Mailchimp to make e-newsletters a cinch. Creating pricing deals for customers is also quick and easy to do.",
Best Customer Service.,Jeff K.,President,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 14, 2017",5,4,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Ease of use,,"Overall: VBO Tickets has been the backbone of our customer experience when selling tickets online. They have created a great product and are constantly refining it with new features. Other ticket companies ignored my requests for new features or promised to ""look into it.""

Good option for small orgs,Anne Y.,Development Director,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 16, 2016",4,4,3,3,5,10.0,Comments: VBO has a lot of really great features that were not available in our previous ticketing system. We especially like the fact that their ticketing pages are embedded into our web pages so the customer sees a seamless site from start to finish. They are continually making upgrades to all areas of the software which mean they're constantly improving. Their reporting features are not as intuitive or malleable as we'd like. It would be great for them to add a custom reporting center where the client can build their own reports based on specified criteria. Hope they do that soon!,,,,

VBO Tickets - Great software for nonprofits!,Aimee Z.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 14, 2017",4,5,4,5,5,9.0,"Comments: We just started with VBO last summer for our outdoor summer theater festival that has over 14,000 attendees in 8 weeks of performances. VBO staff were able to get us up and running in under two weeks, which was AMAZING. (Although I wouldn't recommend that timeline to anyone -- but they can do it!) The software is very user friendly to our patrons who had no trouble moving to a new user experience, and from the back end, with very little training, our entire staff was able to sell tickets over the phone successfully. The back end reporting does need a little help, but the company has worked hard over the last year to improve the functionality, and I am pleased with what the software is able to do now for us with regard to sales reports and data. Overall, I think it's a great ticketing / subscription / member software for the price and staff support. We researched five other CRM systems this fall and ended up sticking with VBO. I would highly suggest a demo with the company to see if it fits into what you need. And if you're not sure, they seem willing to customize the process so it works for you. Would be great for museums, theater companies, symphonies, ballets, operas, who operate year round, but also for music festivals, etc that need it on the occasional basis.",,,,

Because of our experience, they too are excited about building a new partnership with VBO Tickets. Thank you very much for everything that you have done for us.

When we discovered, we were not aware just how amazing they would be at customizing our experience for our small theatre. The customer service ALONE is worth the cost of use. If I ever have a question on how to do something and can't figure it out, they always respond promptly with more information than I would normally expect. I cannot recommend VBO Tickets enough, they're AMAZING!",

Amazing quality and support,Dottie B.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 16, 2016",5,3,5,4,4,10.0,"Comments: VBO's willingness and ability to create special programs for us, a small community theater, continues to amaze me. It has allowed us to move our service up another level, and to rely less on one person (me) so that I can envision passing the ticketing/membership function on to someone else. The only suggestion I would make is that structure is needed in the overall training program. I am now at the point where I am wrestling with reconciling sales in VBO/Stripe/my bank account/chart of accounts and it is very difficult and non-uniform. Key information that I need (what was purchased - a subscription or tickets, and tickets to what event) are not passed over into Stripe, so I have to do a cumber reconcile process in order to allocate a deposit among the various bookkeeping accounts. I would suggest a chat feature. Stripe has it and it has really helped when I have questions.",,,,

We love VBO!,Patrick S.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 14, 2017",5,4,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: VBO ties into our website; we especially like the gift and loyalty card features that allow us to customize those experiences for our fans. The discount flexibility helps us out a lot, and VBO even built the ability to authorize, but not charge cards until we review the transaction - allowing our fans to change their orders up until the day of show. This is viewed by group purchasers as exceptionally flexible, and great customer service on our part. VBO made it possible.",,,,

VBO makes my business possible,Clayton W.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 14, 2017",5,4,4,5,5,9.0,"Comments: I've been using virtual box office for over 3 years now and I can say without a doubt that if they didn't exist tomorrow my business would be in a bad way. We run between 25 and 45 different events every month and the ability to have those auto-populate to our website is a necessity. Also the staff at VBO is VERY responsive. I've asked for added features and the turn around is typically less than a week. I know I'm not asking for anything crazy, but I have trouble even responding to an email that fast.

Customer service is very quick, and VBO is often willing to add or modify functionality based on client input.

Other providers are catching up at lower prices.",,,,
