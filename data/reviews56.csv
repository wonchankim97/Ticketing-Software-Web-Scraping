herogami,"Excellent value for money, capable platform for Agile projects with remote/global teams",Simona G.,Delivery Director,"Information Technology and Services, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,nan,Source: Capterra,"Apr 26, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Quick setup, ease of use, features-rich. The UI scales from a tablet-size screen up to large 30-inch monitors. The software is very fast and data entry for stories and issues is very well designed: data entry in Herogami is effective and quick and this is especially true when entering issues, which is a pain in other competing products. The visual Kanban boards are very clear and cards are well organized, there's multiple views to choose from, including swimlanes based on a large number of attributes. Effort planning and tracking is available as well as ""active notes"" that send comments via emails. Herogami notifies relevant events via email: assign / reassign, closing, notes and comment being entered, etc. Every action is recorded and listed in the project / sprint timeline with links to the entities being modified, this is actually very impressive. The UI is very, very clean and elegant and this contributes to the overall ease of use: our development team was quick to get up to speed with the platform that, literally, felt into our process like none we tested before. This has happened most likely by virtue of its conceptual underlyling clarity and sharpness.",Cons: The product is very flexible. In order to fully leverage all the features you want to spend some time with it. Yet the admin / setup UI is very clear (it's not Jira!) and taking it for a spin is a breeze. Document upload features may benefit from some drag'n'drop hot spots.,"Overall: Our team is sparse and remotely located, with developers living far away from each other. Running a software development consulting firm with a remote teams requires a project tracking tool that is available 24 by 7 and does not get in the way. We found that Herogami provides the right balance in terms of features completeness, ergonomics and cost. The platform is available in the cloud at a very convenient rate and and team setup is a breeze. Projects can be created in a matter of seconds and staff allocated. Agile practices are fully supported (sprints, stories, issues, backlog) and the shared wiki plays a roles in tracking project specs as well as review meetings. Document management and the shared project calendars are also a plus. Overall the platform does a lot for what it costs. Interfacing customer support was a breeze and they responded in a matter of hours. Overall the product is solid and is considerable easier to use than other comparable platforms in the Agile market.","Recommendations to other buyers: The company offers the option of hosting it on your own server, I have not explored this path but it's worth checking."
herogami,"I was tasked to find a good kanban tool, this one is the best",Monica G.,EMEA Supplier Performance Manager,"Mechanical or Industrial Engineering, 5001-10,000 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 19, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Ease of use and very quick and intuitive setup. Once you get to know a couple menus everything falls into place naturally.,"Cons: Very few. A native mobile app would be great, yet the web version works great on both iPad and iPhone with a little attention. Kanban is not a tool for small screens anyway. I contacted support and got told that a mobile app for iOS and Android is on its way.","Overall: We manage a portfolio of complex projects with sparse and remote teams. Herogami does an excellent job keeping everyone in the loop. A good balance in terms of features and ease of use, not too simple that it feels like a toy, not too complex to get in the way or require external consultants. It'a a 5 stars product for me and my team of approx 50 people.","Recommendations to other buyers: The company offers the option of hosting it on your own server, I have not explored this path but it's worth checking."

In any view you have a vast list of options to filter your data and nobody in my team has never had a problem to retrieve any information.

The sprints dashboard is so tidy and essential that you could share it to any external stakeholder without the fear to be incomprehensible.

Data entry forms are very effective: you can easily manage the rapid flow of ideas tipical of a brainstorming without losing a bit.","Cons: After few months of use, I miss the possibility to create a new task directly from the kanban lane and save and share customized views.
