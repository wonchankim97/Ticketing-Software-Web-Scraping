bookwhen,BOOKING SYSTEM EXCELLENCE,Kimberlee P.,Company Director,"Health, Wellness and Fitness, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,16-Jan-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Its simple to understand, offers lots of features, its support team is always available.",Cons: Nothing.,"Overall: I considered many different booking systems for my fitness business - but none of them offered the simplicity and user clarity that Bookwhen does. I can create recurring events with customer payment facilities attached easily, run detailed reports to understand booking trends, collect customer information for mail outs. Bookwhen even offers creativity to make the customer facing pages the same colours as my brand, upload my company logo, attachments, feature social media buttons etc.Bookwhen's own features even prompt me to gear my business in new ways: various ticket types offer the ability to sell to the customer in various avenues, without over-complicating things. Even when I wanted to offer a commission-based element to my business that they didn't already support, I approached the team to see if they would code something specifically to support my business needs and together we made it happen. This sort of service is second to none.The best part is that anytime I've ever needed support (which is a lot) I can use the instant chat feature, email and even call the support team to get approachable service and considered help.Within 2 years using Bookwhen my business had grown from a sole trader to a large limited company - without such a fluid booking ability for my customers this would have never been possible.The subscription price is competitive and the features and service are top notch, I fully recommend Bookwhen.",Recommendations to other buyers: Using this software makes scheduling events and customers payments and reporting easy.
bookwhen,The perfect fit,Claire C.,Director,"Leisure, Travel & Tourism, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,12-Jan-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Ease of use/very simple back endUser-friendly, clients find it easy to use and we have never had someone, not book due to the difficulty of the booking system.Great design - Clean and neatDoes exactly what I need it to doExcellent support","Cons: NothingI think it has more features than I am making full use of!","Overall: I spent months trying to find the perfect booking system to meet my needs. There were many good products on offer, but nothing that gave me what exactly what I was looking for...there was always a compromise somewhere. I then found Bookwhen and it was a perfect fit. It has revolutionized the way we operate our business. It is user-friendly, very easy to navigate both backends and for our guests and it has a great design/layout which matched the look and feel of our website. Bookwhen also offers quick and professional support whenever you need. I was able to share feedback, so when the new system was introduced with the new improvements, I felt that my feedback was taken into account and that we had grown together! It really is a fantastic booking system, our business is running at 100% occupancy and I feel that this is partly due to the ease of online bookings. We will be going into our 5th year with Bookwhen and I cannot recommend it highly enough.","Recommendations to other buyers: I feel I have a personal relationship with the support team and that I am valued. When I am asked to feedback on certain things or when I feel I want to feedback on something specific to the software, then I am heard and where possible when they update the system, these new features are available."
bookwhen,"Really flexible for a variety of businesses, useful for scheduling with different types of tickets",Kelsey k.,Business Manager/Repair Tech/Web & Graphic Design,"Computer Networking, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,6-Jun-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: I like Bookwhen because I sought it out to deal with a client who runs a business that deals with pet transport adoptions. They coordinate a drive up from the south to New England every 2 weeks, and need to register all of the information about the animals (where they're going, their health records, etc) and also assure that each dog has an appropriately sized kennel on the van. It's a little confusing, but because of the nature of the business, it's really important that everything be done safely and efficiently. Bookwhen allows us to set up transports, register the dogs, and take down information not only on the rescue the dog is coming from but also their new home. I use Bookwhen for some other, routine businesses that need yoga classes or other things run, but ultimately what keeps me recommending them for scheduling is that Bookwhen works for complicated businesses who need to take in a lot of info from customers, customers need different ""seats"" (crate sizes) and sometimes other information at intake. Bookwhen allows for _all_ of it, which is the best possible scenario for us.",,"Overall: Super flexible. Schedule what you want, with the types of tickets you want, with the information you want without much fuss.",
bookwhen,Brilliant Bookwhen!,Nicola H.,Recruitment & Relations Manager,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,14-Jun-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: Its easy to use from both our perspective and the customer facing side of things. We've been using Bookwhen for a couple of years and it has completely changed the way we do things. Attendance lists are easy to create quickly but also to download and manipulate to suit our needs. We love the way you can send links to whole public pages or just specific events. The event reminders are a great help in ensuring people arrive for events or get in touch to say they aren't coming. Customer service is brilliant. We rarely wait more than 5 minutes for a chat response. They listen to our feedback and it been great to be able to influence improvements for ourselves and for other users.,Cons: There are a couple of things we'd like Bookwhen to be capable of but they are fairly minor and the company have already promised to add them to their development plan so I'm pretty confident we'll see changes over the coming months.,,
bookwhen,"Easy setup, reduces admin, excellent support.",Christian H.,Management Consultant,"Banking, 10,001+ employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,VR,Source: Capterra,27-Jun-19,5,5,5,5,5,9,,"Pros: We used it to run training for hundreds of employees, and it made it much easier, as they could pick a time that suited them and also manage their booking (reschedule mostly) which lifted the burden of admin off ourselves. Also handy features like automatic reminder emails the day before training, and the ability to export the data gathered during booking (email addresses used for follow up material and surveys).","Cons: Nothing, it is easy to use. I suppose there could be some limitations if you have very advanced requirements, but then you probably wouldn't be looking for a service like this.","Overall: Very good. The staff were fantastic, and their support articles were very well set up.",
bookwhen,"No need to look anywhere else, Bookwhen is the best option!",Claire L.,Founder,"Health, Wellness and Fitness, Self-employed",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,26-Jun-19,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Ease of use, excellent customer service and fantastic pricing.","Cons: There are minor limitations... eg it doesn't integrate with Mailchimp yet. But this is offset by the excellent customer service - willing to listen to suggestions, always respond quickly to confirm whether your idea is already on their list of things to look at etc...","Overall: Bookwhen has enabled me to run my tiny yoga studio with a lot less stress. I had been thinking of just doing bookings by SMS etc, but within 48 hours, Bookwhen had already demonstrated its value. There is zero chance I would remember everyone's bookings/cancellations/changes if it was done by SMS. With Bookwhen, my customers can make their own changes whenever they need to, meaning I don't need to get involved.",
bookwhen,A great little booking tool and all for free!,Clare C.,Customer Success Specialist,"Computer Software, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,21-Mar-18,4,4,4,5,5,10,,Pros: It has a simple interface where you can customise your event(s) and take multiple bookings or limit to just one booking per customer.,"Cons: It used to look a little dated but they recently got everyone on the old version to update to the new version (still free - yay) and it looks better now. It would be nice if you could customise the public facing page a little more, but for a free package, I'm not complaining!","Overall: Helps us to stay organised when customers book in with us for webinars, consultations and online training sessions.",
bookwhen,A truly 5-star Booking System *****,Carl B.,Head of Quality and Compliance,"Education Management, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,16-Mar-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: The software is great and does exactly what you would expect from a booking system. It is extremely easy to navigate for both an administrator and from a users perspective. As well as the basic features you can also get the bells and whistles depending on your plan (at a more than reasonable price).,,Overall: We ran a successful Parents' Evening that was supported by an excellent product.,
bookwhen,Best Booking Software Ever!,Leonie M.,Owner,"Food & Beverages, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,21-May-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Not being very tech savvy, I find this system so easy to use.I run a small home-based business so it's great that Bookwhen is not and expensive to have.Excellent Customer Support.It has all the features that I need.","Cons: I would say that the TROLLEY symbol should be bigger or a CART function needs to be applied as when some customers want to make multiple bookings, they don't always notice the trolley symbol near the class and so they book and pay for each class seperately. This causes an inconvenience.","Overall: It's easy to use, affordable, has great features and customer support is always great.",
bookwhen,"Great product, service and support.",Brad M.,Lead Coach and Owner,"Sports, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,12-Jan-17,5,4,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: Support team are awesome, friendly user interface, explanatory back end. Responsive to ideas and features users need. Decent payment portal transfers and option. Discount features/options for users.",Cons: Back end could always have a few tweaks here and there. Mobile layout for block bookings could be a tiny bit clearer.,"Overall: I've been using bookwhen since its first iteration for my coaching business after looking around for the best balance of affordability and features. Throughout my use the support team has been there every step of the way, when I've found issues or got myself confused they've responsed FAST always looked into and solved my problems.","Recommendations to other buyers: If you're looking to an affordable, straightforward booking system for adbanced bookinga for classes, courses, shows or anything of that nature. I can't recommend this enough."
bookwhen,Fantastic Customer Service,Lucie B.,Yoga / Pilates Teacher,"Sports, Self-employed",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,18-Jan-17,4,4,4,5,4,10,,"Pros: Lovely interface, helpful staff and good value for money","Cons: Exporting lists to excel etc is untidy so end up having to do copy and paste which is dull and time consuming, hard to search back for particular customers e.g. by name.",Overall: The book when team are always on hand to offer fantastic help and customer service without making you feel inept! The 'new' version is very easy to use with a great looking customer interface. There are a couple of things that could be improved or added but the team are always welcome to feedback. Very happy and suits my small business perfectly!,"Recommendations to other buyers: Wish you could make your homepage a bit more customised - other than just a picture, e.g. layout etc. Would be nice to add on features such as wait list or reminder emails as a payable extra e.g. Lite plan but pay an extra å£2 a month for wait list. As a small business I can't warrant the cost of the next plan up when it's not necessary but it would be nice to have the features that come with it."
bookwhen,Once you have learnt how to use it it is great,Catherine P.,NZPF Programme Co-ordinator Central North Island,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,15-May-18,5,4,4,5,4,10,,Pros: The capturing of data for enrolment means that parents do not have to write on the enrolment forms. We can easily see how many bookings we have and comunicate with them,Cons: The Waitlist function can't have an extra question the birth of your baby. We need this function to be able to see what other groups babies and their parents can join,,
bookwhen,Great Product!,Kelly K.,"Marketing, CEO","Marketing and Advertising, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,20-Nov-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: I like that Bookwhen is easy to use, allows for customization and is affordable.",Cons: We like just about everything about this software. The only thing we would change is allow for duplicate emails when registering guests.,"Overall: We schedule all of our companies events through Bookwhen and are very pleased with this software. The software is fast, reliable and easy to use and customize. Plus, the prices are great!",
bookwhen,Love it,Liz S.,Pole fitness studio owner,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,15-May-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: I absolutely adore this booking system. It is super easy to use and is great value for money. It is easy to set everything up and take payment online or cash payments. Groups of bookings is possible, continual bookings and course bookings are available.",Cons: I would like to be able to see past bookings for longer periods of time. Being able to see bookings from a month ago would be fantastic and a way of printing out the booking sheet with contact details of my clients would be great too. I don't know if this is already an option and I just haven't found it yet.,,
bookwhen,"Great, easy to use",Debbie R.,Owner,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,15-May-18,4,4,4,4,5,10,,"Pros: Easy to set upEasy to manageSaves timeGood priceReply quickly to messagesSimpleEasy to adjust","Cons: Would like a membership option where clients can book 1 or 2 classes per week anywhere on the timetable and this currently isn't possible.Would like client profiles to enter info about current members and prospects.Link to MailChimp would be amazing.",,
bookwhen,It works perfect for my small business.,Renee V.,Owner,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,15-May-18,5,5,5,4,5,10,,Pros: I like the ease of use for my side and the customers side as well. Also the charge for using the service is affordable.,Cons: Wish I could sell products on it. I would sell my artwork products. Once in awhile when a customer cancels a class it does not refund their money.,,
bookwhen,Great customer support and great for small businesses like mine.,Lisa L.,Director,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,17-May-18,4,4,3,5,5,10,,"Pros: It's a good price for what I get and it works well for my purposes generally.I like to use the voucher system but don't think I get the most out of it because I don't know how.",Cons: I really want to have reminders and waiting lists but will never need the extra bookings or admins so the package is limiting for my use. The landing page could look smarter and some of the print is too small or not obvious. eg voucher code and select number should be easier.,,
bookwhen,Great for children's classes!,Laura H.,Director,"Music, Self-employed",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,3-Sep-18,5,4,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: Bookwhen was the only booking software I found that was really tailored for running children's clubs and classes, not primarily an appointment booking system, which I didn't want. It is simple for my customers to use and although it has taken me a while to get all of my information on and work my way round the system (but then don't they all?) it does everything I need it to do. The help service is really good, offering help articles, live chat or on the phone. They are UK based and real quick to respond.","Cons: Just the time it took to work it all out, but all the other trials I did were the same, I don't think there is any quick fix!","Overall: Brilliant, exactly what I was looking for.",
bookwhen,"Overall an excellent product, affordable option for small and tiny businesses",Andrea B.,owner,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,15-May-18,5,4,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: The cost: I teach CPR as a hobby and net profit is only a few hundred a year. Bookwhen has been an excellent low cost option that meets my needs well. My customers can pay online if they want, they can see my scheduled classes and the details and locations for those classes.","Cons: Just minor things: There is a little bit of confusion when there is the option to pay at class - the checkmark to pay later is kind of buried for the user. Also, some of the more advanced scheduling could be a little smoother, but overall it's very good.",,
bookwhen,Bookwhen Software Rocks,Tanya T.,,"Hospital & Health Care, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,24-Jan-17,4,4,4,5,5,9,,Pros: Ease of using the product.,Cons: There needs to be an easier way to manage people that are on the wait list. Both in terms of viewing a list of all people on the wait list without having to scroll through all bookings and in terms of contacting them and booking them into a different time slot.,"Overall: As a small non-profit ticketing software can be overly expensive for our organization. Bookwhen offers a great product that meets our needs at an affordable price. There customer service is fantastic, they are very helpful and we found them to be quite responsive. They continue to add new features each year which has given us additional functionality. Highly recommend this product!!!",
bookwhen,Simple but powerful,John H.,Director,"Sports, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,18-Jan-17,5,5,4,5,5,10,,Pros: It's easy for a new client to book into a class and easy for a regular client to use repeatedly and quickly. It's also easy for coaches to check on class attendance and it's veratile enought that we can use it for all of our needs.,Cons: Its clunky to keep track of cash payments and doesnt have a dedicated page for taking register once the class begins.,"Overall: Dont underestimate Bookwhen. A tiny application compared to some other software booking packages but it's versatile, powerful and great to use. My clients find booking easy and repeat bookings even easier. I'm very happy with it.",Recommendations to other buyers: It's easily the most cost effective software on the market. At a fraction of the cost of GoTeamUp or MindBody but a realistic competitor.
bookwhen,Best point of sale for educational programs.,James L.,"Senior Manager, Discounts",Telecommunications,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,15-May-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Ease of use, user interface, fees, notifications, registration forms, discounting, customer service, payment interface",Cons: Filtering events. It is difficult to create a link to filter to only a specific category of events. A lot of learnings on URLs needed.,,
bookwhen,I have received a lot of help from them even though I have the most simple package.,Rosemary J.,Instructor,"Sports, Self-employed",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,18-May-18,4,5,4,5,4,10,,"Pros: Simple to use for the clients and for me. I find adding classes or changes times easy to do. Email confirmation is fantastic, also easy option to cancel. The help I have been given by their team has been second to none. I always recommend Bookwhen when people ask about it.",Cons: When I started I had the waiting list option and someone on list would be contacted if a place became available. I cannot afford that any more as my business is very small and I don't earn enough to have that.,Overall: I am not constantly getting telephone calls to book classes and then have to do so. People can book as far in advance as they want - which is useful for a popular class as I can only have six people in a session.,
bookwhen,This has been one of the easiest quick wins for my business. It has streamlined my booking process.,Verified Reviewer,Instructor,,Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,15-May-18,4,4,4,5,4,10,,"Pros: Ease of use, tagging classes to be able to categorise them, the discount functionality, the teams speed of response.","Cons: It is not a difficult system but it can take a few months to iron out any small quirks to make it match your exact business needs.There are a few minor functionalities that I would like it to have like a client notes section but the team know about this and add it to their list of modifications for the future.The CSV file it provides me does not give me the exact MI I need so I am having to adapt to it. That said I have not spoken to the team about it so maybe it can be resolved.",,
bookwhen,Helped for a good period of time,Bradley M.,Social Media & Communications Advisor,"Sports, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,27-Nov-18,4,4,3,3,5,6,,Pros: Simple and works well on a laptop and mobile devices.,"Cons: Was promised a lot, most membership options however after waiting and being assured it was ""one the way"" never happened despite promises. Had to move elsewhere.",,
bookwhen,"Ease of use, seamless interface for purchases, and outstanding customer service.",Jason M.,Owner,"Health, Wellness and Fitness, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,21-May-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: User friendly functions on both sides, customer and consumer. The calendar function, and POS is very transparent and easy to use.",Cons: None that I can think of. Since I've started using the system they've listened to user suggestions and update accordingly.,"Overall: Mainly for the clients experience. A fast, easy way to book appointments.",

The online help was superb and really quick. Since using the software I have saved a lot of time on administration, feel more organised and my students also like it and find it easy to use.","Cons: I have been using the software for almost a year and cannot think of any cons apart from I had some trouble finding my fees charged by Stripe, but that was nothing to do with Bookwhen.","Overall: Reduced administration time, fewer cancellations",
bookwhen,Couldn't function without this product!,Justin S.,Managing Director,"Professional Training & Coaching, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,12-Jan-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: ease of use, ability to help run our business",Cons: nothing,"Overall: We discovered Bookwhen 5 years ago by chance, and have been using it every since to book learners onto courses for several of our clients. We simply couldn't run elements of our business without it and it has helped us to sell courses by providing the booking system from Bookwhen. The Customer Support is excellent, always responding to help and often doing what you needed to do there and then. Highly recommend.",
bookwhen,Just what I needed for my jewellery classes,Elizabeth Anne N.,Jewellery Designer / Maker and Teacher,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,7-Jul-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: Easy to use for both administrators and customers.

It saves me a lot of extra work, I can just concentrate on what I'm good at, delivering the classes and making my members sweat!",Cons: Takes a little time to get used to. I'm not the greatest with online stuff anyway so it took me a little while to get my head around some of the features but I suppose that's the same with learning anything new.,"Overall: Bookwhen has automated a lot of my booking process and allows my members a number of options when it comes to booking, cancelling or transferring. It also offers us a professional looking booking system that is uniform across the brand.",

bookwhen,"Excellent features, service and value for money",Angie L.,Instructor,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,20-Feb-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: Great range of features and ease of use. Perfect for smaller and bigger enterprises. Fantastic customer service v,Cons: Public face could be more visual. When there are lots of classes I think visually it might be hard to select an option for users.,,

After spending days trawling through lots of different booking systems, I decided to take the plunge with Bookwhen. It is so very easy to use and is beautifully straight forward! Whenever I have needed to query something, the support team is always there to help and ususally contact me back in a couple of hours. It has been a lifesaver to my business and has meant my admin is not only reduced but recorded. There are so many systems out there but in my opinion Bookwhen is THE best! Others have far too many things to get your head around whereas bookwhen does what it says on the tin. I have shown and recommended Bookwhen to lots of my colleagues, who are also impressed with the service. 5* all the way!",
bookwhen,"Freedom from the chores of invoicing, hooray!",Gina D.,Owner of Gina Davies Autism Centre,"Professional Training & Coaching, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,11-Jul-17,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: It is easy and manageable for both me and the customers.

bookwhen,Bookwhen: To Use or Not to Use?,Melissa L.,Owner/Operator,"Professional Training & Coaching, Self-employed",Review is based on a free trial,NGC,Source: Capterra,5-Dec-18,4,5,3,3,3,5,,"Pros: Bookwhen is extremely easy to setup! This super user friendly platform can help you with group events such as, meetings or classes. Bookwhen also offers email reminders to help reduce the amount of ""no shows.""","Cons: Even with the most expensive package, Bookwhen does not have the ability to integrate with other apps that supply text reminders. While they do have some integration capabilities with payment processors and such, those capabilities are very limited. Bookwhen is also very limited on its personalization options.","Overall: Overall, I was disappointed with what Bookwhen had to offer. I only used it during a free trial period and quickly switched back to a program that had the features I liked.",
bookwhen,"Since using Bookwhen for our training programmes and events, our workload has reduced significantly.",Trish O.,Teaching School Administrator,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,24-May-18,5,5,5,5,3,5,,"Pros: The software is easy to use and adaptable. The waiting list function is brilliant and the reminders sent before an event works well for us.

I was able to schedule multiple events in minutes and save time in comparison to other booking services. The customer support via live chat is amazing and gives you a chance to ask any questions to help you make the most of Book When. The updates on support information are brilliant and it is clear that the customer service team listen to issues raised in order to provide a clearer guidance for future usage. I am very impressed with the software.,Cons: I have yet to find any thing negative to say about the software. I suppose it would be nice to customise my booking site slightly more but it is not necessary.,Overall: Easy service for myself and my customers,

bookwhen,Quick and easy bookings for our sling library,Jennifer T.,Sling Librarian,"Philanthropy, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NO,Source: Capterra,29-Jul-19,5,4,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: This software is easy for customers to use and takes the load off us, because we know that once the maximum number of bookings is reached, nobody else can book, so we don't end up with over-attended sessions.","Cons: Setting up new events is a little long-winded... if we could copy an existing event and change the date, that would be handy. If I accidentally click on our own account link, I can't sign in as admin, so I have to re-enter the general Bookwhen page to log in. Also, when we send customers a link to our page, it seems to send them in to one particular time slot, and the less logical among them don't realise they need to press back to get out to all the available booking slots.","Overall: We run a sling library for local parents, holding three sessions each month. We're volunteers doing it for free. We were finding that far too many families were turning up for us to deal with, meaning they had to wait ages to see us, and we were stressed, run off our feet, and running over time, ending up late to collect children from school and nursery. We set up a Bookwhen account so we could organise the sessions (so everyone doesn't arrive at 11am) and set a maximum number of available slots. It's made a really positive impact... we no longer dread busy sessions and customers know they won't have to wait long.",
