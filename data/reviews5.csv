ticket_tailor,Ticket Tailor are an extremely stable online management system for selling event tickets,Gareth S.,Marketing and Event Manager,"Music, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,25-Feb-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Their system can be used as stand-alone and/or integrates fully with your website and social media customer touch points.Set up of your own box office is relatively easy, but it easier still if you spend time writing all or marketing information and promotional pictures before you log in. Then have everything ready to copy and paste and upload the images. However, you can save your event pages as drafts to return to later, or update at any time.You can set up different methods of payment to suit your requirements and can design the interface to match your brand.Once set up your box office becomes fully automated, so you can check in to your dash board as frequently or infrequently as you wish and check sales and data as you wish.They have an app you can download to your smartphone to be used for checking in, which saves on buying or hiring in barcode scanners and gives great data and feedback on attendance for future events.","Cons: As a small event's organiser, there is not a lot we dislike. The only modification I would like to see is to the monthly payment plan.It jumps from one event payment plan to 5 events. Maybe they could introduce a 2 - 3 event plan?","Overall: Selling and monitoring of event ticket sales can be managed through your website and social media sites and becomes fully automated. It gives you an online booking office and enables the booking procedure UX to be easy to complete and payment can be secure through systems like PayPal. It automatically sends the customer the e-ticket and records their information for you to access at any time, along with sales data that can be invaluable for marketing and setting up other events.You only pay per event or within a selected number of events depending on your payment plan. You pay monthly for the period of sales you want and can stop it at any time.",
ticket_tailor,For the independent musicians,Edward W.,Booking Agent,"Music, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,VRI,Source: Capterra,13-Jun-19,4,5,5,4,5,9,,Pros: I really like the ease of use and how simple it is to setup a store front for tickets. Super quick set up time and very accessible to manage and make quick edits if needed,Cons: I dislike the fact that we cannot customize the look of our tickets and rather are stuck with the default 'QR' coded squares that are the printable 'tickets'. We would like to see something that allows us to be creative with the presentation of our tickets and make them feel like actual concert tickets,"Overall: Overall, very pleased with the software and no major qualms other than the ticket customization. Very low learning curve, quick money deposits, relatively inexpensive fees and can always reach out to their team if needed.",
ticket_tailor,Best value in event ticketing services,Jason D.,Chief Operating Officer,"Broadcast Media, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,13-Jun-19,5,4,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: The best thing about Ticket Tailor is the flat fee pricing model. You can charge as much or as little as you want for tickets, and not worry that they are taking a cut of every ticket sold. Especially for expensive tickets, this amounts to hundreds of dollars in savings.","Cons: There are a few use cases that I've come across for which it isn't ideal, but I've contacted the developers and they are very helpful with taking suggestions and offering ideas. I will freely admit that some of my use cases are fairly esoteric, so if you're just doing a fairly normal event you should have no issues.","Overall: Overall we've used TicketTailor for almost 10 events over the past 2 years and love it. It's the cheapest full-featured ticketing system you'll find, and much easier than hosting your own service to save money.",
ticket_tailor,Customer service and tickets sales,Helana B.,Entrepreneur,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,VRI,Source: Capterra,28-Jun-19,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: I love how the payment setup was effortless on my end and very simple. I took me about 5 minutes to set up my ticket tailor account for my upcoming event. I also love that ticket tailor do not charge you a fee for setting up and using the service what's amazing is they have a pay as you go serviceSo they take a very small percentage from every ticket sale. I also love how you can choose to set up your personal PayPal link or stripe, great service",Cons: Loved everything! Customer service is amazing!,Overall: I had an overall amazing experience with Ticket tailor I have been with ticket tailor for over 2 years.,
ticket_tailor,Extremely easy to use and wonderful customer service,Lauren C.,Test Analyst,,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,26-Mar-18,5,5,4,5,5,10,,"Pros: This is the first time I've run an event and I did a lot of research into ticket selling sites in order to figure out the most suitable site. I had a lot of questions as event ticketing was new to me and out of all the sites I emailed, Ticket Tailor provided the fastest and most comprehensive answers to all my queries. They made me feel very confident about setting up my box office and when the tickets went live they dealt with queries I had immediately (both queries turned out to be user errors!). This is such an easy website to use and very intuitive. The Ticket Tailor Help Centre is also very good and most answers you can find in their FAQs.",Cons: There is nothing I can fault about ticket tailor but I was unable to combine selling tickets for my event with the ticket purchasers ability to book preferred time slots which was important to the smooth running of my event.,"Overall: As a first-time charity event with a very small budget, the cost effectiveness of using Ticket Tailor as opposed to other sites meant that more of the money raised went to charity!",
ticket_tailor,Ticket Tailor,Naijha W.,Executive Director,"Entertainment, Self-employed",Used the software for: 1-2 years,VRI,Source: Capterra,13-Jun-19,5,4,4,5,5,10,,Pros: It's easy to learn. User-friendly. We're able to use it as a ticketing system for all of our events.,"Cons: I would like to be able to modify the ""buytickets.at/....."" URL. Most times are events are free for attendees and vendors need to pay a fee to register. The attendees get confused with Free being associated with a ""buytickets.at/....."" URL.",Overall: The cost is a major reason why use this platform. We have a for profit and non-profit business so the monthly subscription rates are extremely fungible reasonable compared to Eventbrite overall fees.,
ticket_tailor,Ticket Tailor great value for the price.,david l.,Computer Training Specialist,"Computer Software, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,18-Jun-19,5,5,4,5,5,9,,"Pros: Love the fact that there are no fees, unlike Eventbrite.Easy of use, very easy to use and has help if you get confused.I can pause my service , so not paying monthly fees is a great feature.I can have multiple box offices, makes it easy to have different events.They seem to have frequent upgrades and keeps me informed about any changes.","Cons: Wish I had more options on customizing the ticket page.Not much else is to say, by no means a perfect product, but a really good product.","Overall: Ticket Tailor is a really good product, it makes selling tickets a breeze and is easy to use. I help organizations ( not for profits), when they want to sell tickets , this is my go to software. Been using for about 2 years and it has not failed me yet.",

The site is exceptionally user-friendly and the monthly package - as opposed to hefty commissions charged by rival sites - is advantageous to my business model. No hesitations whatsoever in recommending it.,Cons: Nothing really comes to mind - I'm sure it will continue to get better and better.,,
ticket_tailor,Deep functionality ticketing system for flat fee price,Ross S.,,,,NO,Source: Capterra,3-Jan-16,5,4,5,5,5,10,"Comments: Ticket Tailor is a fully fledged ticketing system but instead of charging a per ticket % commission like competitors, it provides a single fixed fee monthly fee with unlimited tickets. For smaller events this provides a far more cost effective way of developing a ticketing system.",,,,
ticket_tailor,Saved a ton of money,Lori G.,Ownerr,"Health, Wellness and Fitness, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,13-Jun-19,4,4,4,4,5,9,,Pros: Price is great. Run a bunch of events per year and event brite was eating too much into my profit. Ticket Tailor does not have the breadth of tools that some of the bigger players do but they cost so much less it is worth it to me as a small business. This tool does everything I need it to do.,Cons: Missing some key features related to emailing ticket holders (although they have upped their game in this area they still have some way to go) and their reporting is really minimal and not what is needed on the back end.,Overall: Overall - happy with them and plan to continue using them going forward.,
ticket_tailor,Excellent ticket sales programme,Nikki W.,Senior Development Officer - Alumni Relations,"Education Management, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,2-Jul-19,4,4,4,4,4,9,,Pros: The ease of setting up an event and the collection of money,Cons: The inflexibility of some of the options i.e. you cant currently add values to some of the drop down boxes,Overall: I get great service and the system looks good,

ticket_tailor,Ticket Taylor Ticked All My Boxes For Selling Tickets Online For An Event,Steve P.,Boss ;-),,,VRI,Source: Capterra,10-Jun-15,5,5,4,5,5,9,"Comments: Having recently being tasked with sorting ticket sales for my old colleges reunion, I searched to see if there was on online ticket solution to my dilemma as the former students were now all over UK/world and I had no direct contact for them.This is where I found Ticket Taylor. On researching other companies of similar attributes, Ticket Taylor came out on top especially in the value for money department.On signing up to the package, I soon found the site very easy to use. You can also SEO the ticket office to suit direct hits for potential online searches.The system is, in my opinion, faultless. It made what a thought would be a cumbersome task into something very delightful.The process of buying a ticket online was simple. I created links from the Facebook page and my website to the online ticket office.I could regularly extrapolate information from the data collected by Ticket Taylor.I found the e-ticketing system very useful indeed.During the use of their system I had little need for help But when I did, their messaging system was simple to use and the small problems I had were dealt with quickly and in a very friendly manor.",,,,
ticket_tailor,"Stable, Cheap and Customisable",Alex M.,IT Manager,"Primary/Secondary Education, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,3-Jul-19,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: After looking at alternative online ticketing solutions we were initially drawn to TicketTailor by their competitive pricing, but they have proven to be great. Their platform is stable, easy to use and very customisable. They even offer a charity discount on top of their low pricing! We weren't sure about choosing someone other than the brand name for organising events online - let's call them Shiny Events - but TicketTailor have met all our expectations.","Cons: The only inconvenience we've found is that TicketTailor fees are paid to them via credit card, whereas card transaction fees are debited by their payment provider (Stripe) from the remittance. This has caused our accounts team a few challenges as the bank account we're having the remittance paid into isn't the same as the bank account with a credit card! Not a show stopper, but upset our finance team a little!",,
ticket_tailor,Excellent and intuitive ticketing tool. reasonably priced too!,Joann S.,PTA committee organizor,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,24-Oct-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: intuitively designed, even a non-technical person like me can use itexcellent price range, with non-profit discount and NO TICKET FEES!! (plan and event size dependent, of course)","Cons: maybe because I am a technology layman I wasn't able to fully make use of the linked/connected apps as fully as I hoped.. (I attempted to connect Zapier, but was not successful... but that might just due to operator error...)","Overall: Overall excellent product, should be used a lot more vs those that charge ticket fees!!!!!",
ticket_tailor,I find ticket tailor so user friendly and unbelievably useful,Harriet B.,Community Fundraiser,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,28-Feb-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: It is straight forward and easy to use and saves me so much time when selling tickets for events. I particularly like the ability to duplicate a past event which saves the time of setting up a new one.,Cons: I generally like all the features of the software. The only thing is it might be nice to have a prompt to check that you have done everything that needs to be done before putting tickets on sale - once or twice I have forgotten to change the email response sent when a ticket is sold which has been quite confusing for the buyer!,,
ticket_tailor,Outstanding service and customer communication at an affordable price.,Mathilda L.,Theatre Director,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,18-Feb-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,Pros: Monthly subscription making high volume low price tickets possible for small businesses.

Ability to easily create coupon codes. The Box Office that lists all of our events on one page. Easy to understand and use Dashboard. There's a lot that we love.,Cons: Not much to say here.

Meaning the ability to make the Box Office look and operate more like a lead page for example.,Overall: It has absolutely simplified our workflow relative to putting on events and collecting the admission fees. We love it.,

After trying a half-dozen ticketing partners over the course of 4 years, we've finally fallen in love with a platform - Ticket Tailor. The platform has virtually every feature set you could ever want, it integrates seamlessly on your own website, processes credit cards simply with Stripe, and best of all - is offered at a cost that is unbeatable. Moreover, unlike every other ticketing platform, Ticket Tailor allows the event organizers to charge and keep ticketing fees, which can greatly help the bottom line of an event. We look forward to a long term partnership with Ticket Tailor!","Cons: This platform has just about everything our business has been looking for. Easy to use, affordable, and great customer service!",,

Eventbrite has now removed the cap on how much they take per ticket. We have been searching for an alternative with no hope in sight for more than a month. We switched to Peatix to realize AFTER we moved everything over that they don't pay out until the event occurs. With customers buying tickets more than a year in advance for us, this was simply unacceptable for our cash flow. Finally, someone recommended Ticket Tailor to us, and we have been using it seemlesly for more than a month. We are so thankful they exist, and we hope this review helps more people in our old position to find them.",Cons: They do not (yet) have a waitlist for tickets.,Overall: We are so thankful they exist.,

It's super easy to set up events and sell tickets and customer support is always spot on, but the best feature is the price! There is 1 low monthly subscription fee rather than a % fee on tickets which saves us hundreds of pounds per event. Highly recommended!",Cons: The event view for guests could do with some design. Ability to add tickets below the description would also help.,,
ticket_tailor,30 year old dream come true,Adrienne F.,Owner,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,VRI,Source: Capterra,13-Jun-19,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: Ticket Tailor was very easy to use, and most importantly, integrate into our existing website.

We're continuing to use it, and we'll let you know if we run across something that doesn't work!","Overall: I've waited 30 years to launch the business I've just launched - Conundrum House, which offers Live-Action Role-Play games that I and my team write (Black Ink Mysteries). I've not used a ticketing service before, needed one, and my daughter recommended that I use Ticket Tailor.

Being able to build and manage our own ticketing pages saves a huge amount of time, means we can absorb the booking fee (and set it reasonably) and receive funds immediately rather than waiting for them to be released.",Cons: Very little as a small event. Perhaps a little more flexibility in design/style for our landing page.,,

I only use what I need. It has saved our PTA so much time and effort too,Cons: I have to do a lot of rework on the reports but that is mainly because Parents fill the questions in incorrectly.

The customers' payment portal is user-friendly with an optional ""donation"" feature that we love, and the Tazotix smartphone app makes it a breeze for us to check in our attendees by scanning their barcode or finding them on the door list. We highly recommend TicketTailor for any small business or not-for-profit who wish to keep their running costs low.

At first I was very skeptical of paying for this program when their customer service was only an email. I was not sure they would be able to answer quickly whenever I had a question.

The functionality is also great - we can customise the checkout process easily to ask for menu choices, allergies, attendee names etc etc. Our parents love the ease of paying online and we have definitely sold more tickets as a result.
