Entreflow Consulting Group's use of Eventbrite,Aislinn K.,Marketing Assistant,"Management Consulting, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Apr 17, 2019",5,5,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: The top feature for Eventbrite is that it's really easy to track events and the attendees that are coming to your events. You can create an event very easily, share it across multiple platforms, there's a direct link to your Facebook business events page from Eventbrite. Making it super easy to get the word out.","Cons: So, some of the requested features; we would like to see more customization in the actual Eventbrite page itself and as well the emails that are sent out to your invitees. So at the moment, I think there's only two templates and you can't really do much to change the look and feel, or the text within it, so it would be great to be able to customize those features a little bit.","Overall: It's good for anybody that's organizing an event obviously, the nice thing about Eventbrite is that it's free to use long as you're not charging for the event. There is a fee if you are charging for the event so the fees are 2.5% plus 99 cents transaction fee. So that's a service fee to Eventbrite for using their platform. Again, this is only if you're charging for the ticket, and then if there's a credit card use, then the credit card fee is 3.5% which is quite high, but when you factor in the time to chase attendees for invoice payments it's kind of a no brainer",
State of the Art Event management,Janosch F.,Human Resources Consultant,"Internet, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 24, 2018",5,4,4,5,5,8.0,,"Pros: I used Eventbrite a couple of times when booking events for myself or colleagues. It was simple, easy, had the information I was looking for where I expected it to be and all (comprehensive) steps that led me through researching the event (MTP Hamburg) to choosing what I specifically wanted to finalizing booking completely without any hassle. A while later I had to organize an Event myself and remembered my positive experience as a user, which I wanted to provide to attendees of my event as well. It was then, that I realized how much this has to do with the way you setup an event from inside Eventbrite. There is a verry good guide for setting up events and a step by step tour for beginners. There also are recommendations about what to do when and what information might be expected by potential attendees. I liked the basic support which was included as a beginner. Also, there are areas where Eventbrite clearly draws a line regarding its functionalities and forwards you to connected third party services (as for example if you want super fancy badges or have more esoteric data mining procedures in mind regarding your attendees data). As a newbie to event management AND Eventbrite in particular I was also happy about the broad spectrum of FAQ and help videos. I was very happy to be supplied with a solution that provided me with high quality, easy to use features and was free to use for my non-profit event on top of it.",Cons: Speaking of FAQ and learning how to use Eventbrite it is true that there is a lot of material available online. Sadly there is also light and shadow to this. Some of the explanations I found online were clearly dated and others did either not cover the specifics of the topic I needed (recommendation / invitation based multi stepp application requests) or referred to things which had been changed in the past. Also the Options for the design and look of the Event Homepage were limited. These aren't necessarily bad things only. BEing forced to stay with a simple (but still beautiful) Layout as well as required to go with a simpler application process then I imagined in the end turned out to be good as it simplified things and allowed me to concentrate on matters more central to the event I was planning. It just needed some letting go first and willingness to do it differently than I first had imagined.,"Overall: The event I attended which was managed via Eventbrite hat serval hundred attendees. From a visitors perspective anything worked flawlessly and smooth. The event I set up was a lot smaller but also worked out great from an organizers point of view. I am confident Eventbrite played a central role to this as it streamlined the organisation and the preparation as well as positively supported the execution of the events. Eventbrite is a modern, fast and anticipating web application that is easy to use and works for teams colaborating in organizing small and obviously medium to large sized events. It also funnels some of your more exotic ideas about how your event should work down a reasonable lane, which is healthy, es pecially for newcomers and the less experienced. I simply can recommend Eventbrite and will use it again for our followup event(s) in 2019.",
Solid Event Hosting Option With a Few Quirks,Marc H.,Director of Marketing,"Marketing and Advertising, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: GetApp,"Jan 26, 2016",4,4,4,4,5,8.0,"Comments: With a large number of ""event applications"" out there, Eventbrite has found its way to the top of that list thanks mostly to their easy to use interface and well thought out back-end that not only covers all of an event host's bases but also integrates with other areas of their marketing. Free to anyone who isn't requiring payment for tickets, Eventbrite makes it easy to quickly put together a good looking registration page fast, without the hassle of payment or subscriptions. The paid feature for anyone requiring ticket fees is a little more rigid in how the user can collect it's money which can make it a little tougher to work with depending on how badly you need the revenue from your ticket sales. The payment processing fees are still reasonable, though.","Pros: -Powerful system that provides a large number of great features (creating, promoting, tracking, checking-in, analyzing) for free -Event page creation is quick and easy. If you want something simple, you can be done in minutes. If you want to customize different areas of the design and registration process, you have that ability as well. -Integrations with outside marketing platforms like HubSpot and MailChimp allow the user to connect their other marketing platforms together to create the most powerful event marketing toolset you could ask for. -Relatively good analytics and reporting sections gives you solid insight into how successful your event was and where you can improve moving forward. -The mobile application (Neon) for event hosts makes checking in attendants a breeze by either scanning the printed tickets Eventbrite provides or just finding their name and swiping your finger across it! -Customer support is relatively attentive (I've averaged around 3-5 minutes on hold before speaking to a representative via phone) and the knowledge base they've set up on their website it pretty helpful when it comes to answering some of your intermediate-level questions around customization and platform functionality.","Cons: -The paid feature is a little rigid when it comes to payout structure compared to other options. You normally can't receive payout for your ticket revenue until your event ends, making it a tough option for those looking to promote an event months in advance who need the revenue now. Definitely something to consider. They provide early payout, but depending on how much revenue you're expecting to generate, that may not even be a viable option. -Customizing your registration page with your brand's colors, logos and images can be difficult and require some coding skills. You also won't be able to get rid of the Eventbrite branding so anyone looking for total design control may not like this option.",,
A solid simple event registration platform,Verified Reviewer,Director of Marketing,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: GetApp,"Sep 11, 2018",4,3,4,3,3,9.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is fairly simple to use and has most the features you would want laid out so you can build an event registration form in steps. Once you set up your account(s) if you are accepting payments, it is straightforward to duplicate events to make new ones as long as they require similar details. There are custom fields you can create with logic behind them so different users may have different options depending on the access you choose for them. There are also ways to create discount codes or hidden fields with different levels of access. This is very useful when you have tired pricing at events and variable discounts to various groups.","Cons: A lot of the settings are in places that don't make much sense and you have to go to completely different sections of the admin section to find settings that you would think are closely related to each other. Some of the features are on by default and you might never notice them until after your event registration has launched. Even though most the settings are easy to change, you basically have to go over every tab, page and setting to be sure they are all correct before you launch your campaign. When you use the custom data fields and discount features, it isn't immediately clear how it all works and again, you need to go to a couple different pages to get them set up properly so it takes some trial and error.","Overall: This is a great solution for simple, straightforward events without too many options. Once you get a lot of different sessions or tracks and registration types, it either can't accommodate or becomes very complicated to manage. Like other tools of this nature, there is a bit of a generic feel to it but that is the compromise for a widely accepted overall, plug and play software. It is effective but there are other solutions that are similar or easier to use and offer more customization options. It is highly likely that we will replace this software with something else in the near future.",
"Great functionality, amazing when listing free events, fees are a bit expensive for paid events",Verified Reviewer,Director of Marketing,"Professional Training & Coaching, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: GetApp,"Oct 29, 2018",5,5,5,1,3,8.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite has lots of functionality that you will need when organising and managing an event. It is very easy to use, plus it can integrate with other apps such as Mailchimp which comes in handy when broadcasting an event and Surveymonkey which comes in handy to send out feedback forms post an event. The back office functionality is great too -- you can email invitations directly without using Mailchimp if you wanted to. For users, it's easy and simple to register, plus Eventbrite offers a secure online payment option which is hassle free for both organiser and attendee.","Cons: 2 things that I like the least about Eventbrite are: 1) Non-existent customer service. One of the reasons why I used Picatic (which they have now bought!) was due to their great customer service. You can chat with a real person who can help you with some of the questions which are not answered in their FAQs. 2) They're great if you have a free event, but if you have a paid event, their transaction fees are one of the highest in the market.","Overall: I organise a lot of professional networking events, some are free and some are paid for. Eventbrite offers me all the functionality I need to organise my event. I used Picatic until Eventbrite recently acquired Picatic. However, customer support from Eventbrite is very difficult, if not existent. So if you have a question not answered by the standard FAQ, such as, ""Since Eventbrite acquired Picatic, how I can access my previous/ currently live events""?, the only way I could find customer support was by tweeting Eventbrite. So, Eventbrite is great if you can self-service and publish free events, but once you have quirky questions, be prepared that it will be difficult to establish contact to a human person who can answer.",
Eventbrite makes life easier!,Simone F.,"Media, Development and Marketing Consultant","Philanthropy, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Nov 16, 2017",4,5,4,4,5,10.0,,"Pros: Easy to use. You can have your event ticketing up and running in minutes. I have been using Eventbrite for ticketing for about five years. It has helped make event management so much easier. I used it for school admissions and event purposes, for nonprofit fundraising events where tickets were complimentary, etc. It is easy to specify the exact questions for my guests, gathering data on them that helps me in other areas. Easy integration into websites and emails. I have recommended Eventbrite to so dozens of businesses, organizations and individuals. Easy to use product and with all that I often have going on, it's nice to know I can depend on Eventbrite to quickly make a difference.","Cons: You can search for a registration based on a registrant's name. However, you cannot print a report by Registrant's last name. Not being able to print a registration report by the name of the registrant is the only reason I gave this product four stars instead of five stars. Help screens are good. The help response I received was very clear and easy to follow. It would be nice to have a live person to do a chat box with or talk to but so far, all of my questions have been addressed either in the Help screens or when contacting support.",,
Free platform for nonprofits to utilize,Abigail D.,Digital Marketing Specialist,51-200 employees,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 31, 2018",4,5,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: I work at a nonprofit with a small marketing staff. Before using Eventbrite, we were building our events on our website which looked awful and dull. It would take a lot of time for not much reward. With Eventbrite, I can create a basic event in a matter of a few minutes. I can make it private or public to be shared with the Eventbrite community. Best of all, most of our events are free to enter, which means it's free to post them on Eventbrite. It's easy to check attendees in at the door, download reports, and communicate last-minute messages with registrants. Eventbrite is a great tool more companies should take advantage of.","Cons: In some instances, we've held events that require many conditional questions to be completed during registration. Unfortunately, Eventbrite doesn't allow the function of complex, conditional questions, which can really slow down the registration process. On the backend, the menu names aren't the most intuitive. There are certain functions that are difficult to find, such as where to cancel an order, but after expanding each sidebar menu, you can usually find which what you need. My biggest pet peeve with Eventbrite is that if you create an event that takes place more then five weeks away, ticket sales will automatically be set to end in five weeks from that date, regardless of when your event takes place. There have been many times when I've forgotten to change this default date and received complaints of ticket sales being closed weeks prior to an event. I wish Eventbrite would make the default date the date of the event.","Overall: Eventbrite is free for free events, easy to set up and looks professional.",
Eventbrite Keeps the Clouds Away from Your Event,Linda L.,Funeral Concierge,"Hospital & Health Care, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Oct 08, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Planning an event can be difficult without the use of an event management software. My preference is Eventbrite. In today's society where people are so busy managing their own lives, its hard bring people together. From a moments notice, to 2-3 weeks in advance, using Eventbrite can make sure your event is anything but successful. Eventbrite offers tools to assure that you can keep up with the logical changes while you are on the go. It also makes it easier for invitees to respond while they are on the go. Its a win win with Eventbrite. It cost effective (no more purchasing expensive invitations and costly postage) and convenient.","Cons: Eventbrite needs to implement a 911 response team approach for customer service. Hit it, respond to it, solve it! Also, so many people are use the service now, I am unaware if it has safe guards against crashing and; if it does... what happens to my information? I do think that due to the high percentage of users at any given time, the system slows down considerably. This can be frustrating when trying to pay for an event or responding to an RSVP. The goal is stay focused on the goal. To assist users in planning and executing hassle, stressfree events.","Overall: My overall experience with Eventbrite has been great! I have read some unfavorable reviews but, that has not changed my mind. I have utilized Eventbrite for internal company events, planning external other social events and purchasing tickets to events. It easy to use and hassle free for the novice or the experienced party planner or event manager.",
Wanna go for events? The best place to find them instantly and track them over time.,Verified Reviewer,Funeral Concierge,"Information Technology and Services, 1001-5000 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 13, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: I have been using this application for over a couple of years and attending events from time to time.

It doesn't show you only the nearest events but within the country that makes use flexible to register and attend them based on our choice.

I have attended various events listed by Microsoft, Google and others that regularly publish them for free to attend tech conferences and stuffs.

Apart from this, it provides and interface where you can register for events, download tickets, receive notifications, manage your user profiles, filter events based on different categories or pricing, and much more.","Cons: Certain sections(common categories) keep repeating on the homepage of the application which could be avoided, although not sure if they wish to keep users engaged to click on them or for easy access.

Could improve the user experience to some extent!!",Overall: Must watch application if you love staying up to date with events across the country..,
Awesome Stuff,Bryan R.,,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Oct 08, 2016",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: What do you like best?

If you know what you like and you choose your interests accordingly, the recommendations are always spot on. It's hard not to find something that would interest you and there are always lots of free events. I had to download the app before I moved to Glasgow because I bought a conference ticket through Eventbrite, but then I started to tinker with it out of curiosity and it quickly became a very useful tool. I was new in the city and it quickly exposed me to a lot of stuff I wouldn't have known about otherwise, I even managed to sneak into an Industry Day type event only older students were supposed to know about (and it was great, by the way).",,,,
Helped our Check-in time by 55%!!!

I'd like more (easier) customization options for the novice, but I know I cannot have everything. Some of that may be me as I worked with Apple quite a bit and their Training and documentation my have me biased. They have a bite-sized Micro-learning modules for just about everything! We've used at least three others and this is leaps & bounds better than those!","Pros: OK 1) Easy-to-use Interface 2) Outstanding Central Hub for an Event 3) Helped us to Sell Tickets and Take Registrations - made it a lot easier to do and explain ""how to do"" for others 4) Whether at my desk or mobile at-the-event I can see and access everything! 5) User-Experience continually comes in at well-above 95% - Better than anything we've ever used! 6) Eventbrite's honesty because they tell what it CAN DO and then they help you to figure out (using a 3rd Party) to get what you want ! I am not going to go on and on, but I guess I just did! Lots to Eventbrite!","Cons: I'd like to get payout/ticket rev before the event ends, but I suppose it could be us. Also, I am not savvy as I should be to change/update colors/graphics/look-and-feel, so for me it was a lot of launch campaign, but forgot____... Or did not clearly know how to ____. I did access their online tools/FAQs and other training, it was just OK, not stellar. However though, I deal a lot with outstanding companies (Apple) that provide bite-size micro-learning modules for just about everything, so maybe it's just my bias.",,
Streamlines the Concert Going Experience,Drew M.,Merchandiser,"Apparel & Fashion, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 07, 2019",5,5,4,5,5,8.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite presents a very smooth interface, and is a great and easy way to discover and purchase tickets to events. I love it that it allows you to add any tickets purchased through the software to your Apple wallet, and I also appreciate that it keeps an archive of all the past tickets that you've used through them; for those like me who enjoy keeping their physical tickets as a memento of sorts, this app does it for your digital tickets automatically. All of my transactions with Eventbrite feel safe and secure.","Cons: One time I purchased tickets for a concert, but ended up missing it due to something unforeseen coming up. This was the only event that the app did NOT keep a record of - the tickets have disappeared from my past archive. I would like to see this tweaked where the app saves not only the tickets used, but also those unused.","Overall: As a huge live music fan, Eventbrite has been a great way for me to find and organize my live music itinerary. They are my go-to option for discovering local music events, and the ease with which you can purchase tickets and use them in other apps (such as Apple wallet) has really made the concert going experience easier for me. I appreciate the smooth functionality of the app, and its suggestions about events I would enjoy based on those I have previously attended. Highly recommended.",
Reliable and easy to use,Verified Reviewer,Merchandiser,"Public Policy, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 08, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is extremely versatile. I have used it to create events, to purchase tickets or RSVP to events and frequently, to search for events. To create an event page, Eventbrite makes it as easy as possible for you. From there, you have easy access to who is and isn't attending, and also receive a guestlist for your event which you can use for check-in. From personal experience on the user side, I love that once you've RSVPed, you get a clear confirmation email that allows you to easily 'add' the event to your calendar of choice (or you can do this from the Eventbrite page right after you've RSVPed), and Eventbrite plugs in all the relevant information into your calendar. This always saves me so much time and usually encourages me to attend the event. I imagine that the participants signing up for events I have created in the past have also enjoyed this feature.","Cons: There is not a lot of customization available. You don't get to control the font/size or other design-related aspects of the event page so the event information and photo are all presented in the same way for each event. I have, in the past, generally used Eventbrite in combination with other softwares, e.g. a FB event page (that links to the Eventbrite for RSVPs).",,
Couldn't do my job without Eventbrite,Meagan F.,Organizer,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 05, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is amazing for event planners or anyone who ever hosts a gathering, event or activity. It's super easy to set up, integrates with Facebook, has its own email feature (or connects with MailChimp, etc.) You can create coupon codes, password-protected events, free events, etc. There's an app to help with check-in or on-site purpose. It's really the best all-in-one ticketing software.","Cons: If you're running a super specialized event or event series, this may not be the best option for you. For example, we run a Theatre Festival with multiple performances a night for one week. We used Eventbrite for the first year, but have since switched to a specific theatre ticketing platform. Eventbrite is great for general use but may not fit every planner's need.","Overall: I couldn't do my job without Eventbrite. The easiest way to sell tickets to your events, fundraisers, galas, etc.",
It's the customer service cycle that never ends,A G.,Communication and Operations Director,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 03, 2017",4,4,4,1,4,6.0,,Pros: It's great for general admission. And good for reserved seating.,"Cons: (1) Customer service. So far it has been almost impossible to get a hold of them.

(2) Reserved seating does not allow customers to select their own seats AND refuse them from leaving an empty seat. Hale Center Theater allows you to do both. You can see more at https://hct.org/online/. I'd love to see Eventbrite incorporate this feature. Maybe they do but I haven't been able to get a hold of anyone and started reaching out on Tuesday. It's Friday.

(3) Comped Tix: Can't purchase comped tix and non-comped tix at the same time. Must go back into the system to buy more tix.",Overall: I sent an email on Tuesday and haven't heard back from Eventbrite. I have spent hours on their blogs and I still have several missing questions. I called there on-boarding program and you can only leave a voicemail. I'll update if I hear back from them in the 24 hours they promise.,
Automate and Streamline your Events!,Marcus H.,Customer & Communication Strategist,"Education Management, 10,001+ employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Aug 01, 2019",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite serves as a semi automated planning service that is mostly free to use. It allows you to book events, invite a few or a mass of people via spreadsheet or other import functionality and schedule the timing of when the invites will go out. Furthermore, it can do follow up reminders and keeps track of who opened the invitation, the attendance, and what type of ticket was purchased. Most importantly, it allows you to offer many types of attendance tickets, including a virtual attendance option if you're livestreaming. This is crucial if you're trying to get an accurate headcount of people who will be physically in attendance at your event.","Cons: The multi user interface gets a bit tricky during set up. If you want multiple individuals managing your events, the set up is initially a bit taxing but once its up and working, there isn't an issue. There should just be a click and go functionality for assigning managers and users.",,
Eliminates the need for physical invitation cards.,Justina E.,Account Analyst,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 13, 2018",5,5,5,4,5,10.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite provides me with an easy way to register friends and families for events. It perfectly eliminates the need to share invitation cards to closed associates ; as I can simply send a mass,one-click email invite to everyone. Eventbrite also allow recipients of the event invite to either print out the invite or download it as a .pdf file on their smartphone.

More importantly, this platform enable me check-in attendees by using the Eventbrite Organizer mobile app. to scan QR codes on event tickets.","Cons: Eventbrite becomes very costly when you offer paid tickets on the platform. Apart from the initial charge,which allow you create the event on the platform, there is a ten percent charge on the total amount of tickets sold via the website.",,
Great for Free Events!,Nick A.,District Staff Development Coordinator,"Education Management, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Sep 19, 2018",4,4,4,5,4,8.0,,"Pros: Working in education, there are a lot of events I like to put together, and not everything has a cost, but the ability to track attendees etc is still needed. Eventbrite doesnt charge for free/small events! Everything is easy for the basic user to do. There are a number of customization features you can apply and it even integrates with website builders pretty easily. I have been on both ends using Eventbrite, both as an organizer putting it together, and an end user, making a purchase or attending an event via Eventbrite and the interface is simple on both sides. There is also an app to use on your phones.","Cons: There are a number of customization features, but colors aren't one of them but this is pretty minimal as an issue. I just want to get the even up and running and promote it to allow for people to register and all of that works with Eventbrite. It has taken off and you really can't go far without seeing it being used.",Overall: I have been happy with Eventbrite. This is a solid event hosting/creation program with a great interface and userability.

Its not fully Free for users. Only if the events are Free then the events can be setup Free of Cost. If there is any ticket cost for the event then one has to go for the Eventbrite Paid solution options, It does allow to pass the Eventbrite payment to pass on the attendees but overall it does involve a cost and not fully Free for the event organizers.

Users of Eventbrite may not necessarily be looking for ""library programs"" but are merely perusing local events and they come across us alongside even paid types of activities, concerts, etc. People who might never see us because they aren't regular library users will come to know us because we were billed alongside more widely know groups.",Cons: As with any new tool there is a learning curve but once we figured out the ins and outs of copying and pasting links to Eventbrite into our in house calendar it couldn't be simpler.,"Overall: Eventbrite has been extremely helpful for our library. We cannot only advertise through them but also limit the group size by being able to offer online tickets. This has been amazing in helping us keep events more streamline and manageable. In addition, when tickets ""run out"", we are able to see the need to offer perhaps other slots of an event or programs of a similar nature in the future.",

Many customers don't have this figured out but luckily there's always also an attachment to the confirmation email which also has the QR code we need, or we can pull up like a will call list on our scanner's app or print it out on paper - lots of ways to make it work makes that process pretty smooth. I love the functionality integrating with Facebook, where a) you can sell tickets directly from a FB event, like not even navigating away from that FB page for the sale, and also b) it's very easy to create a fb event from the admin backend of an event's ticket page.","Cons: It seems like with the recent acquisition of Ticketfly, many reps who came over from there weren't really trained on the differences with this new service, and aren't much more helpful than just clicking around and figuring it out on your own.",Overall: I'm a house manager at two different small performance venues that have switched to Eventbrite from other services within the last couple of years. In some ways the adjustment has been tough but overall we're pretty happy.,
Top Notch Customer Service!,Molly T.,Event Producer,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 06, 2018",5,5,5,5,4,8.0,,"Pros: The ease of use right from the very start. It's so easy to get your event up and running with minimal steps. They also make it easy to customize your event to stand out. We use Eventbrite for all our events. We recently had an event get postponed two hours before the event because of a sudden, unexpected snow storm. It became a complicated situation to resolve, but eventbrite quickly stepped in to help us get it sorted for the rescheduled date. Their team truly went above and beyond",Cons: That I can't add a sub user that already has account to my event. It means my team has to create multiple accounts to run different events for our clients.,,
Excellent registration process for our events.,Greg F.,Commander,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 24, 2018",5,4,5,3,5,7.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite doesn't charge for events that don't have a registration fee. It gives me a full-featured registration program for my non-profit's events so I can track flow of communication, know who signed up and track event participation across the year. We only pay fees for the events that have an associated cost for attendance.","Cons: The software is so robust, there is a significant learning curve and it can be easy to miss one of the fields for communication that goes to attendees. Recently, there was a poorly worded addition to the Terms of Service that caused a bit of a flareup....claiming IP rights to things way out of line!....but management rolled that back pretty quickly. (If staff have a desire to write ToS that is out of line, will it happen again after this flareup settles down?? Be vigilant...)","Overall: Free registration tracking program with little or not cost. Historic tracking of member engagement with our events. Ability to do credit card processing for paid events, while still getting free access for events with no ticket costs.",
I'm grateful we discovered Eventbrite!,Diana K.,Associate,"Outsourcing/Offshoring, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 12, 2017",5,5,4,4,4,10.0,,Pros: It offers the option to create access codes and promo codes that can be given to specific customers by sharing the URL/link for them to redeem,"Cons: When transferring the ticket to another attendee through ""edit"", I loose track of the origin of were the ticket came from since the initial name disappears at all.","Overall: Eventbrite has facilitated my business life so much that I've even persuaded my coworkers from other departments to start using it! The feature I love the most from Eventbrite is that it provides the option to create access codes in order for our attendees to redeem our previous offers or rates. We've had other scenarios where they purchased a registration but ask for the previous rate so we had to refund, and it't very easy to locate their registration and proceed with the partial refund. This makes my job lot faster!","Recommendations to other buyers: Add the option to keep track who was the original attendee, even after editing the attendee information and transferring to a new person"
I use Eventbrite for collecting event registrations.,Ashley M.,Alumni Relations Coordinator,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 16, 2018",5,4,4,4,4,10.0,,"Pros: I use Eventbrite a LOT, for a lot of different types of events. I love that Eventbrite can be molded to match a lot of the events I'm doing. Some are free events where I need to collect user information, others are paid events where I have to collect dietary information for meals, and other events could just be a place for me to collect payment for a collective order. No matter the event, I've found a way to use Eventbrite and save myself so much time! I use to use internal spreadsheets for everything, and accept mailed payments. Thanks to Eventbrite, I can share a link and move on to the next task on my list!","Cons: Eventbrite can do so much, it's really irreplaceable. I think something that could take Eventbrite to the next level is a seating arrangement function. I think they have the ability to allow buyers to select their seats, but I have some events where I assign seating. It'd be great to take the registration list and assign them a seat, all on Eventbrite.",,
We use Eventbrite for all our events!,Molly T.,Project Manager,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Oct 03, 2018",4,4,3,5,4,8.0,,"Pros: I love Eventbrite because they have top notch customer service. They always are quick to solve any issues I may have. It is a breeze to set up events, even multiple date events. I love how the back end makes it easy to see how many tickets were sold, how much net/gross, and linked pixels. All our team can use it and understand how to make changes which says a lot because we have quite a few that wouldn't consider themselves tech savvy.","Cons: There are actions that I wish I could complete like hiding certain dates that are linked to other dates. It isn't possible, but the customer service helped me find a workaround.",,
Eventbrite - Best in Class for Networking Events,Sara J.,Founder,"Computer Software, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Jul 30, 2018",4,5,4,5,4,9.0,,"Pros: The online registration, ticketing, and social sharing aspects have led to Eventbrite becoming an industry standard. As industries, and institutions have continued to adopt it, and global penetration expands it's reach, the ability to identify events based on topical relevance anywhere can facilitate the orchestration of communities and help them grow. It not only helps get the word out, but it increases effectiveness of collaborations across institutional silos or barriers to facilitate learning, and participation. The ability to monetize on a tiered basis (even offering free access), manage levels of participation and customize, share content, and find similar events, all contribute to the value and enable participants to become more involved to achieve shared goals.",Cons: The ability to create microsites for events that could be linked to a sponsors website where dynamic and interactive content could be updated may enhance future versions.,,
"Simple, easy and great.",Leon C.,IT Recruiter,"Information Technology and Services, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Sep 27, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is a simple, functional and reliable for both event makers and users. Creating an event is as simple as creating a social media post, you can even organize free local events around your area, manage ticketing , reserved seating among others. The Interface is very straightforward and supply many options in how to create or search for an event.",Cons: Getting a hold of Customer support is nearly to impossible. This is the only downside I can really think of when speaking of Eventbrite.,"Overall: Eventbrite has helped me not only by facilitating event creation, but also by helping me find events around me. I think that even if you do not need to create an event, you should totally try it out if you are the kind of person always looking to do something new and exciting.",
Great Product. If you're simple.,Verified Reviewer,IT Recruiter,"Internet, 51-200 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Sep 25, 2018",4,5,4,3,3,7.0,,"Pros: - ease of use

- visibility to consumers via their consumer facing product

- flexibility in payment for customers

- how quickly you can get an event up and running

- lots of plugins for your site/mobile/affiliates","Cons: - No cross selling opportunities (would love to sell tickets for additional attractions when they buy admission)

- Doesn't allow for complicated packages (at least at our tier)

- to upgrade costs more than we've ever spent on ticketing system and requires a pretty solid contract

- More complicated packaging of tickets -- ie: ticket to enter, plus beer token, plus parking, plus etc. etc. with the ability to add money on demand",Overall: The company has clearly focused on destroying the eco system that Ticketmaster had cornered. They've done it. The platform they provide is great and I hope to see them develop even more modules for event planners to use and grow their event. I DO wish that they would offer some of the abilities that their RFID products have into eTickets as well and that they would offer that functionality at my current tier.,
"It is like the ""easy button"" for event-planning",Virginia B.,Communications Manager,"Information Technology and Services, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: GetApp,"Jun 15, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is simple, intuitive, and makes event-planning incredibly easy. This application allows you to create both free and paid-events. If you are enrolled in a subscription for a paid-event, you can choose to opt-out at any time with no additional fees attached, etc. Because of the increase in visibility, this application provides, we have received more registrants for our events through organic traffic (more than often our registrants come from direct traffic or referrals). Eventbrite also captures various analytics on your events (that can be viewed within the applications dashboard or easily exported) that help you analyze and understand your audience, where your traffic is coming from, and keep track of sales, etc. One of its best features is the availability to access details and analytics on your event at any time, from any advice, so you can save on time and focus on other important matters.","Cons: The free version does not provide you with the option to ask registrants questions when they are in the process of purchasing their tickets. The ability to ask questions was beneficial to our company because it helped us gage our registrants' level of experience and/or areas of interest, to better understand how to engage with them during events, etc.",,
Solid Platform; Lacking Some Features,Michael M.,Senior Content Manager,"Human Resources, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"May 13, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,8.0,,"Pros: It's free, to start at least, and just an amazing way to track and analyze attendance at a wide variety of events. It's easy to create events and share them across multiple platforms.","Cons: The fees start to add up if you are charging for the event and paying to use Eventbrite. The credit card fee of 3.5% seems particularly high to me. Also, the emails and event pages are not very customizable. I think there are only a couple email templates, so some variety there would be nice.",Overall: My organization hosts events all over the world and Eventbrite has been a life saver. It helps us both get the word out and track trends over time.,
Successful Event organizing,Imelda C.,Business Owner,"Transportation/Trucking/Railroad, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"May 31, 2019",4,4,5,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: What i like about Eventbrite is that you can find all event help and right people you need in order to make an event purpose happen. Every event has its purpose or goal and the right performer, speaker, audience and tools will make it a successful one. You can find performers, magicians, speakers, entertainer where profile, reviews are available. Book them easily with the messaging or communication feature of Event Brite. Event brite also notifies you through email on every inquiry or reply you get. You can not find any application or software that would match How Event Brite is performing and all members are satisfied and happy with it.","Cons: I am satisfied with its performance, features and events all over the world can be accessed. I just hope that Eventbrite can think of exploring more features taking each event to the next level. Maybe someday it would have this feature where regardless of what location or country you are, you can also have the feature of making international talents perform in a different country. Through sponsors i think its possible.",,
Exciting Online Event Creator/Registrar,Verified Reviewer,Business Owner,"Non-Profit Organization Management, Self-employed",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Sep 14, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is intuitive and fun to use. When you are geared up to post your event, Evenbrite won't disappoint you. It has all of the lights, bells and whistles needed to effectively manage, post, register, handle sales for and publish your event online yet the GUI is easy to work with for a newbie.",Cons: I wish it presented more choices for color themes for your events webpage.,"Overall: I used to run a small charity and have posted many events for it through Eventbrite. I love that your events will be posted all over the web, on other entities event calenders, etc., shortly after publishing on Eventbrite.",
Standout Option in Event Management,Verified Reviewer,Business Owner,"Events Services, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Dec 04, 2018",4,4,4,5,4,8.0,,Pros: Eventbrite continues to produce results as the highest ranking site for 'local business networking events' searches. Its intuitive user interface and integrated marketing tools make it a standout for event planners like me who plan hundreds of events.,"Cons: Because it offers so much, some of its tools are lower priority for its developers and do not work as expected. The pricing structure makes more sense for large high ticket-price events than small ones, making it difficult to justify as a long term solution for growing monthly events.",,
Eventbrite is great for planning events,Kathleen D.,worship pastor,"Religious Institutions, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Aug 01, 2019",4,4,4,4,4,7.0,,"Pros: I have used Eventbrite to plan 8 events for 500+ people at each event. It really is very nice to use when you need your guests to fill out specific fields in order to make your event successful. We hosted an event where we needed 800 guests to be seated at 90 specific tables. Eventbrite did very much help us to be able to sell tickets to a broader audience and organize them as best we could. The Facebook integration is very helpful to sell tickets through our Facebook event, and the check-in through the app at the event from our iPad helped us to get 800 people through the door much faster!",Cons: It is getting increasingly expensive. I feel like the cost is becoming prohibitive to it being beneficial.,,
"Good, but could be better for large-scale events",Liam W.,Digital Marketing,"Events Services, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 20, 2018",4,5,5,3,5,8.0,,Pros: The back office system is great. I especially like how you can quickly pull code to embed ticket sales in different ways onto your website. The reoprting is excellent and it's great for problem solving when a buyer contacts you with a question about their order.,"Cons: Having used Eventbrite for a large-scale event and being on their top-tier product, I'd like a dedicated account manager to be able to call rather than having to use the generic contact us.",Overall: Having used several ticketing services for consumer events Eventbrite is by far the best.,
Probably the best system for event management,Verified Reviewer,Digital Marketing,"Political Organization, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 17, 2019",5,4,5,4,3,8.0,,"Pros: The features that are offered are great. The possibility to offer the tickets in different languages and the extra tools that come with making the whole system one of the best ticket management out there. Also worth mentioning that you can alway use this software, with all its features for free!",Cons: There are some features that are falling a bit behind in terms of keeping up with the ease of use and feel of modern websites. It is something that it can be updated any time so definitely not a major turn off.,Overall: We started using this software since 2010 with our free events. The fact that they would let you use the features for free it's just amazing. We knew that when we started charging we just had to stay with Evenbrite and we have stayed with them for all these 9 years. Not once we switched or even tried another service because it is just a very easy to use and friendly system.,
Intuitive (Mostly) and Easy to Use,Jessica R.,Marketing Strategist,"Food & Beverages, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Sep 25, 2018",4,4,4,4,5,8.0,"Comments: Overall I'd definitely recommend Eventbrite for ease of use, functionality, and overall, well usefulness.","Pros: Eventbrite does a bunch of things really well: ticket sales, event-related email communications, event marketing, and they've added a Facebook integration feature that allows people to buy tickets directly through a FB event without having to visit another website. In my role at a microbrewery, we use Eventbrite for ticketed special events like Beer Flow Yoga classes, or brewery tours.","Cons: Sometimes it's hard to find certain settings, particularly the ticket sales date range. I've accidentally published events that displayed ""sales ended"" for tickets, because the date had changed, and there's a separate field for the timeframe your tickets will be available for purchase. You'd think this would automatically update when you change the event date, but nope.",,
"Quick, Easy and Powerful Event Management",Jennifer P.,Administration and Human Resources Director,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 27, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: We love how easy it is to get event sign up rolling with Eventbrite. It is a powerful platform that allow for all the graphics and marketing touches we love to add on with all the data gathering features that make for strong event management. Quick and complete reporting, easy communication with those signed up, and lots of ticket options to customize our events.",Cons: We really haven't run into anything yet that could be considered a con! Seriously - it is that good!,"Overall: Fast, easy and accurate event sign ups!",
Eventbrite Review,Kelsey C.,Marketing Specialist,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Oct 08, 2018",4,4,3,4,5,8.0,,"Pros: I like that it is a relatively free service, depending on how you want it. They do take a cut of the check, but you can pass those fees on to the buyers. If you choose to absorb the online fees, then it does cost some money. I also like the ease of use. It's very easy to move through the process and set up an event without many hiccups or training.","Cons: I least like the flexibility in designing the event webpage. I understand Eventbrite's need to use their branding and layout, but it would be helpful if you could edit the event webpage to match your branding such as add more pictures, upload a background color, use different texts, and colors. The webpage now just features a photo and logo of your choosing then it's pretty bland.","Overall: Overall, I have enjoyed my experience with Eventbrite. It's great to use, an easy platform, tracking is very easy, and the functionality for both web builders and users is easy to understand.",
Events Locator Eventbrite Review,Samwel O.,Backend Developer,"Computer Software, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Sep 14, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Easy to use with a simple user interface.

Checkout/Event Registration is simplified and very easy. I especially love the feature where if I am not logged in the platform and I am registering for an event, on clicking login link adjacent to user identification dropboxes, changes the input boxes to appropriate input boxes for login and on login, the details are auto-filled in the earlier displayed input boxes.","Cons: Most of the time I have used it, some filters do not work for me. For example as per the time of writing this review, when I select the period of the event eg All Dates, Tomorrow, Next Week etc and click on search, it takes me to https://www.eventbrite.com/notavailable.",Overall: Awesome considering it has enabled me to be up to date in regards to tech events happening in Kenya. I have learnt a lot from these events and met great people in these events.,
Eventbrite - simple to use and effective,Louise T.,Vice Pres,1-10 employees,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Oct 05, 2017",4,4,4,4,5,10.0,Comments: Generally once you get set up with this platform it will make your event management breezy.,Pros: I like the payment options for our organisation. We no longer have to handle cash or cards at our events. The payouts and reports is excellent.,Cons: The templates are not as creative or flexible as some other platforms. I would like a few more options on the template side for emails and then Ii may use the product for more of our marketing pieces. At the moment we couple Eventbrite for ticketing with Mailchimp for marketing.,,
Eventbrite is becoming more and more popular!,Tamieka G.,Program Coordinator,"Health, Wellness and Fitness, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 10, 2018",4,5,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: I love the fact that you can search for events by category and or/city with Eventbrite. Being that it's so easy to use, and becoming more and more popular, many people use the software for all types of events. You have the typical popular events such as shows and concerts, but people are using it more and more for nontraditional uses, such as weddings and baby showers. It's very easy to navigate through the site, and easy to RSVP, sell/buy tickets, and create your own personal event. It shows you the price ranges for events that have cover charges, which is a very cool feature and it even tells you when events are free. It even shows you a map of where the event is located. It's definitely a great product!","Cons: There is nothing that I don't like about the product, it does a really great job at advertisement and creation of events.",,
Start-up event lovers' dream!,Verified Reviewer,Program Coordinator,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 23, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: As someone closely follows start-up events, I think Eventbrite is such a useful and easy to use application. As you browse through events you can favourite it or add it to your calender for reminder and read the description of the event to decide if you want to go. You can see its address and location on map (useful and necessary when you're in a hurry on your way to the event) and see other similar events. I use it to find and share interesting events with my colleagues.","Cons: The variety of events are limited to formal or business events so at times I forget to look at Eventbrite when I'm searching for more casual events. Also the ""About"" section is very useful however when you click on ""Read more"" you are directed to another page. I wish it had a one sentence summary before ""Read more"", the sentence before it usually is interrupted and you don't get an overall idea without clicking on read more.",Overall: Browsing and getting ticket to the event is simplified and I would recommend it.,
Great application for Events that are Free,India O.,Adjunct Professor,"Higher Education, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: GetApp,"Nov 16, 2018",5,4,5,5,5,6.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite has my vote for an easy to use platform to offer and market events that are offered for free. The ability to reserve a space and get confirmation is value added. The app includes reminders keep the events you signed up for top of mind. Another favorable feature is the ability to search for ""Eventbrite Events Near Me"". This feature allows for impromptu outings that are often low cost. The ability to filter by mood, categories, dates or to be surprised help to hone in on the right event for your situation.","Cons: If you are planning to use EventBrite to sell tickets the platform gets more complicated and structured, including the limited ways in which you can receive money for tickets. My professional organization considered using it for small fee ticket sales for member events but the rules and at the percentage taken by EventBrite were restrictive to the point that we didn't move forward. However, EventBrite offers three pricing structures so if you are planning a complex event, wish to get analytics from your event, reserve seating, or need on site staffing and support and have a margin of profit, then EventBrite is worth exploring.",,
Great idea ... but really bad and extremely slow customer support!,Gregory P.,Musical Director,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 12, 2017",5,4,4,1,5,6.0,,Pros: The COST can't be beat. It's great to be able to do this without fees of other traditional Ticketing agencies charge,Cons: really bad and extremely slow customer support! I emailed a question after waiting on hold on the phone for over an hour and got a response A WEEK LATER. Pretty bad!,,
Great for planning events that require tickets,Verified Reviewer,Musical Director,"Events Services, 51-200 employees",Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,"May 09, 2018",4,2,2,3,5,7.0,,"Pros: I used EventBrite to create and distribute invitations to our company's annual holiday party. I was able to input all of the event's details rather quickly and easily, and was even able to upload the invitation that I designed to add it to our 'page' for our event. It's sleek looking, and was fairly straightforward to configure.","Cons: It's not very intuitive. It took me quite a few Google searches just to figure out how to send a reminder email to all of the non-responders. We also had a number of people email us separately to RSVP for our event, and it was rather clunky (and not obvious) to try and add attendees manually. This reason alone will be why we use different software next year.","Overall: This software is great (probably even the best) for users who are planning events that have a ticketing system associated with them. If you're hosting a simple party that won't have a ticketing system implemented, such as a holiday party, birthday party, etc, this software is a bit of overkill. Overall, it allowed me to achieve my goal, which was to invite people to our holiday party and be able to track the RSVPs.",
Great platform for managing an event!,Verified Reviewer,Musical Director,"Education Management, 501-1000 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Sep 14, 2018",5,5,5,5,4,9.0,,"Pros: - Easy to use and navigate - you can build an event quickly

- Great for tracking data and registration purposes

- Attendees can use this to check in to events with ease using .pdf or app

- Lots of opportunities for customizing - search fields, graphics, etc.

- Decent customer support and help available through the website

- All-in-one place - no need to multiple platforms to accomplish these goals","Cons: I don't have many things to complain about with regards to Eventbrite and my experience using it. There was a steep learning curve, as I was new to the platform, but I was able to find help with ease. Depending on your budget, it may be pricey, but consider your long-term goals to decide if it's worth it.","Overall: Positive experience, but I feel that I have a lot more to learn about this platform in order to use it to its fullest potential.",
Software for all levels of experience,Staci H.,Director of Events,"Public Policy, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Oct 24, 2018",4,5,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is easy to use for all levels of planning experience. It's a great tool for free events, as well as paid registrations and ticketed events. The back end of the software is easy for planner (and non-planners) to use. Their customer service is really wonderful. They can set your non-profit organization up quickly to receive lower transaction fees. I don't receive many complaints about the software.","Cons: The only downfall is the challenges in getting 'just the right' logo/image dimensions on the registration page or in the description page. There's not much customizing in those areas, particularly in the description/text area for the main page. It's really a plain text only option.","Overall: I've had a great experience with Eventbrite. I've primarily used them for free events, but a handful of paid events as well. I would recommend them for a 'do it yourself' registration option.",

Simply Awesome!,Sandra S.,Communications,"Religious Institutions, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 15, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: I can offer all kinds of tickets for any of our community events at church. It works just fine. I also love the fact that you can select the type of info you wish to collect from attendees and create a zap in order to have the info transferred to a spreadsheet without having to type it. This automated process is just lovely.,Cons: When you have to charge for tickets the process fee is kind of high. Other than that everything is good.,,

I like knowing that Eventbrite makes it easy for my attendees to add the event to their calendar. An added bonus is the social sharing.","Cons: I would like better integration with Wordpress, and the ability to integrate Eventbrite seamlessly into my Wordpress pages.

This platform has all of the tools that I deem necessary to plan and accommodate small events that I often have to plan for my job. It easily allows me to send out invites, manage guest list, send reminders and register attendees when they arrive. It works so well, that I would easily pay for the service that they offer because they truly are an invaluable asset. Eventbrite has saved me when I literally had 5-7 days to set up an event and manage guest and there needs in order to pull of successful events. Always top of mind for me.","Cons: Eventbrite customer service is limited to none. Thus, that is a major red flag. With any event management platform that's selling tickets for actual money. I can guarantee that some issue would pop up at some point. So to have poor customer service that just wouldn't work for me.","Overall: I have had great experiences with this platform. However, it should be noted that I have only used the free option because the events I have are free. I haven't had any major concerns because these events I plan have a maximum of about 75 people. So great tools available depending on your needs.",
Eventbrite is Awesome!,Beka P.,Administrator,"Religious Institutions, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 12, 2019",5,5,5,4,5,9.0,,"Pros: I love that Eventbrite can be used for personal or business-run events; it's easy to use and personalize, you can email people that have signed up for the event, connect with social media platforms, and follow up afterwards with a thank you. You can use your own theme and graphics or they have lots of great themes to choose from. I like being able to make it a free rsvp only event or one people can pay for and that you can check people in that have already registered once they get to the event! So helpful!","Cons: I can't think of many cons to Eventbrite, but if I had to choose something, I'd say sometimes when I create my own theme that it saves with a funny color and when I choose a different one, it didn't save. Not a huge deal, thought.",,
Eventbrite works great because it makes the registration process easier and keeps it all together .,Mahala W.,Office Administrator/Manager,"Religious Institutions, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 19, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Its an easy way to see how many people are registering, as well as tracking how much you made for that specific event. Also, the cost per transaction is not bad.","Cons: We had an event where the check was never cut or sent to us for over 6 months. Normally it is suppose to be sent immediately after the event. We did finally receive it, but it was only after we requested it.",Overall: We mainly like the ease of use and also tracking for each event.,
Best way to host events,PRINCE K.,Business Associate,"Professional Training & Coaching, 5001-10,000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 25, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: I love eventbrite and using it to host events as well as join events, it's very easy and user friendly. It's also better than constant contact as it allows you to personalize the event and make it really pop.",Cons: I think they could try to include more features into the events i.e. a customization of the page and more. Similar to how constant contact allows you to customize how the page will look.,Overall: Love it!!,
The basic functionality is a cost-effective way to create online sign-ups for ticketed events,Brent K.,General Counsel,"Primary/Secondary Education, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Jan 09, 2019",5,5,4,5,4,9.0,,"Pros: Cost--if you're not creating paid events, you can keep your usage very inexpensive. If your IT Department doesn't regularly build sign-up sites for you, this can give you easy functionality on a shoestring budget. It can be an appreciable cost for low-cost events (because the pricing would comprise a higher percentage of each ticket's revenue), but if you don't have a payment-processing solution, or don't have the financial controls or manual functionality to collect payments, then it's likely worth its value to you.","Cons: If you don't go with a custom design, your audience may recognize that you opted for a budget-oriented solution. That may not be the kind of client signaling you want to send, but the potentially low cost has to come with some kind of trade-off.",,
A Lifesaver for Our Events,Terri B.,Director of Development,"Philanthropy, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Nov 14, 2018",5,5,5,5,4,10.0,,"Pros: This has become so useful for our events. We have at least one a year, including our main fundraising event. This has simplified the ticket sales situation and we have even added our sponsorship opportunities to the site. I like that you can make donations through this as well. It is beneficial that the purchaser pays the processing fee.","Cons: While I like that it asks the purchaser to pay the fee, I wish we had the option to give the purchaser the choice as to whether or not they paid it. While this might seem a bit contradictory, there are different mind sets with making a donor or ticket purchaser pay the processing fees. I appreciate it, but some feel the fees are the cost of doing business and that should not be passed on. So I wish we had the option to make that choice.",,
Ticketing leader,Verified Reviewer,Director of Development,"Philanthropy, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Mar 19, 2019",4,5,3,4,4,7.0,,Pros: It is easy to utilize and set up for any event we have.,Cons: It is a bit outdated on how it merges with our CRM and the features. We use it for endurance events and banquets but endurance events are harder to tailor and they are better at ticket events.,Overall: They are our registration system for all events and they connect to our CRM API for integration so it merges our constituents. They also send info to Crowdrise for the peer-to-peer fundraising.,
reliable event management software and recommended by topmost companies,JASVIN G.,student,"Primary/Secondary Education, 10,001+ employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Oct 05, 2017",5,4,5,4,5,10.0,Comments: their online RSVP's system and convenience to RSVP or organize foe an event is so magically wonderful. in fact it would not be futile to say that from planning to promoting and selling and doing rsvp online has made life easy and so creating an event.,"Pros: it has been a long since i have been using this event management software for my institution to register students and setup an event. had this software not been here, it would be a cumbersome task to register students for an event. and to make any event successful audience attendance is the primary source as well as management. It functions in both the region. In las vegas they have a huge market, where they plan, promote, and sell all the show tickets and they are linked up the engineering department of regional schools and state university.","Cons: it is considered as one of the largest event community spanning all over america and such perfect planning of an event is also needed to outrun this software. in short, i am not so sure about this software's negative side. i would say their service fees and fees per ticket percent rate are high and it does affect the reach of audience attendance.",,
I've used Eventbrite to manage ticketing for small and medium sized venue shows.,Verified Reviewer,student,,Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Apr 20, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite has become one of the leaders in the ticketing world for a reason! I love how easy the process of using the app (from start to finish) is, and how easy it is to track sales and metrics along the way.",Cons: Nothing major - Eventbrite blows any competing apps I've used out of the water. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a ticketing system.,Overall: Easy + affordable customer ticketing for events.,
Amazing event management software,Michelle H.,Development and Marketing Manager,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 13, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: User friendly, intuitive. Support is available 24/7 online. Some of the event management features include attendee, badge managing along with vendor management tools. They offer promoting tools for social media, surveys, feedback options. The volunteer management tool is easy to use. Offers lot of functions to manage and organize any event. Could integrate with SurveyMonkey and possibly other tools.",Cons: Some of the settings are not as user friendly. The custom data fields aren't super clear to navigate. The customer service is not the most reliable. There are some limitations on reporting such as not being able to print reports based on names of registrant. Great tool if you're running smaller events.,Overall: I used EventBrite in the past and it's effective at executing events.,
Very Helpful for Promoting and Tracking Events,Denise L.,Owner,"Education Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 29, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Given Eventbrite is free, it is so handy to use when you have an event you want to promote, post, and track. There is pay function but I haven't used it. I've used it for promo events I have and want to advertise it out to people. It goes online free to anyone searching for events in my area. It's a great tool to track and take payments if you want. It'll get all the information from your people enrolling so you can track them for the future. I network with other small businesses and they all use it from instructors like me for an event to coaches and financial advisors.","Cons: I can't complain about this software as it is free. Maybe I might if I were paying on using it at a different user level, but it's such a nice tool for a small business to promote events. So many of us use it.",Overall: It's a nice well known tool for small businesses or non-profits to use when they have an event to promote whether it is free or paying.,
The leader of the pack,Peter G.,Owner,"Fishery, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 06, 2018",4,4,5,5,5,10.0,,Pros: I used to use other social media platforms to invite customers to events or special sales and promotions that I was having to increase sales and also ultimately traffic to my website. I was a littlw hesitant to use Eventbrite at first because it would take thw customer away from my webpage but the customisation options allowed me to really focus on making my events personal to my busibess. I would get updates the instant someone signed up for an event or a sale that I promoted with EventBrite. They offer an outstanding product and will use them again in the near future,Cons: I do not have too much bad to say about EventBrite other then the customer has to leave my page in order to go to the event page. I wish there was an integrated wigit I could use to bring Eventbrite to my social media platforms,Overall: Im trying to bring customers together and get them excited about what we have to offer. Marketing sales as events with Eventbrite makes it a little less intimidating for the customer to make a purchase as it makes them feel apart of something and it makes them feel welcome.,
Easy webcast registration handler,Verified Reviewer,Owner,"Professional Training & Coaching, 201-500 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 18, 2019",5,5,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: It's easy to create a template and then duplicate it. We offer around 18 different webcasts that repeat every month, so being able to set them up without having to do it all from scratch is nice.","Cons: I don't like it that we are using another piece of software to handle registrations, Eventbrite works great, but our webcast strategy needs some work. We should be using a webcast software that handles registrations so it's a one-stop experience for attendees. This is not a knock against Eventbrite, it's a knock against us!",,
Makes it easy for guests to register for events.,Rolake D.,Financial Analyst,Transportation/Trucking/Railroad,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 14, 2018",5,5,5,4,5,10.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite automates the process of inviting guests to events.Saves paper ,and removes the cost of printing invitation cards ; making it easy for guests to simply register for the event and get an automatic invite email,which they can download as a .pdf file or simply save it on their Eventbrite app.","Cons: Free events created on Eventbrite have very little security as random strangers can easily register and get an invitation for the event.As free events are displayed on the Eventbrite website,with no barrier for strangers to register.",,

I use this site for both personal and professional use. In my personal life, I use it to book and register for events I am interested in attending. When I want to find unique activities happening in my city, I always go to Eventbrite first. I have used this site many times in the past as an organizer, since I am an Event Planner. Eventbrite is so easy to use and helps track me attendance, allows me to send follow up emails to attendees, processes payment from guests...it has been an absolutely lifesaver to me and I could not recommend it enough.",Cons: I have nothing negative to say about this product.,,
Extremely easy to use with great integration,Scott S.,Owner Operator,"Primary/Secondary Education, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Nov 05, 2018",5,5,5,4,5,10.0,"Comments: I love that eventbrite allows for my events to be circulated. After setting up events for myself and a few stores I work with --I do live meditation and spirituality events-- I started to see them in google searches, and circulating on the web. Super easy","Pros: Eventbite! You integrate so seamlessly into facebook! I love you! Easy set up, click and drop, format with low fees and great integration. Easy. Easy and good looking. I even got customers outside of my regular group of folks who attend my events.","Cons: I mean I guess that the website does take a nominal fee from each ticket sold, you can pass that on to customers but I wouldn't. I had some work-around in implementing to my website but they were easily fixed and were more on the end of Squarespace than eventbrite.",,
An event of interest is just a few days away on Eventbrite.,Abimbola K.,Customer Support Agent,"Entertainment, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"May 06, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: I use Eventbrite majorly to locate ""free to attend"" local networking events of interest,taking place around my environment.

Over the years ,I have made friends and expanded my business network ; as a result of events,I found on Eventbrite.",Cons: It's been extremely helpful over the past two year period and it is impossible to find anything I dislike about this program.,,
A great tool to handle the wide variety of events you might have across the globe.,Chris E.,BI Manager,"Consumer Goods, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Apr 10, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,9.0,"Comments: We use it to manage dinners and other events both at home and during remote conventions. Really helps us plan and coordinate resources needed, as well as limit the amount of attendees. Easy to set up and easy to manage, an all around great tool.","Pros: Excellent ability to manage and promote multiple events, and multiple types of events. Simple web interface makes it easy to interact with and delegate actions to others.","Cons: There are always one-off issues with invitees, and it's a bit cumbersome to manage these one-offs. Bu this is common among all tools, not just Eventbrite.",,
"Does what it needs to, but could do more",Verified Reviewer,BI Manager,"Primary/Secondary Education, 201-500 employees",Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Software Advice,"Jun 27, 2019",4,4,4,5,5,8.0,,"Pros: Effective way of managing lots of events; integrates with automation tools (Workato, Zapier, etc.). Clean interface for users",Cons: Refunds! Can only do 1 refund at a time. Integration isn't as customizable. New format for event creation doesn't allow for HTML editing and restricts photo size to be same width of text block (meaning images come out humongous).,,
Better results if an App for phones is designed.,Maria G.,Manager,"5001-10,000 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"May 22, 2018",4,5,5,3,5,8.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is the best software to take into account events, occasions and even parties, or an anniversary, although of course, this is for something more entrepreneurial, since its functions have timetables and it really helps to remember important dates where some important event may occur.","Cons: I would like Eventbrite to add a version for mobile devices, and in this way it is easier to follow the events that are about to happen to the letter. A good follow-up from the mobile phone, would bring better results.",,
Eventbrite is great for SXSW activities,Kathi B.,Project manager,"Financial Services, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Mar 13, 2017",4,5,3,3,5,9.0,Comments: Overall this is a great app,"Pros: Eventbrite is a great application. It is easy to use, Helps sponsors build their email lists and predict who's going to their events. Gathers all (or most) of my event information in one place, and sends reminders.",Cons: How much information does each sponsor need? It would be great if it could remember all my data and pre ovulate/ save me time.,,
Using Eventbrite for our upcoming techers conference!,Amy L.,Director of Development,"Philanthropy, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Jul 11, 2018",5,5,4,3,5,10.0,Comments: I highly recommend eventbrite for any nonprofit event!,"Pros: We used to use cvent, which was very expensive. Eventbrite is giving us almost all of the same features without the huge price tag. We can customize the questions so we can easily gather all of the information we need from each attendee. We can schedule reminders to attendees and those who still need to register. We can have all the information we need about attendees and track any changes they make to their registrations in one place. We also used eventbrite to sell tickets for a concert we held last year and it was fantastic. Easy for ticket buyers and we were able to pull lists for the concert that made guest check- in a snap.","Cons: If your event is not a ticketed event it does require more thought and planning to make eventbrite work. That said, it is doable bacuse the pages are flexible, they can be customized.",,
Easy Event Prep,Jenna G.,Regulatory and Safety Tech,"Oil & Energy, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 04, 2018",5,5,5,3,5,10.0,,"Pros: There are a number of options you can include when sending out event invitations. Minimal hassle for set up. You are able to track ticket sales in real time. It eliminates manual tracking. For participants, all the information they need is ready in one location and tickets are distributed right to their email.","Cons: The app is great. However, when using the computer you need to sign in for every event email you receive and multiple accounts can't be linked. One email address per account and you need to sign in every time.","Overall: Great for events of all sizes especially when the RSVP requires the guest to make choices. Whether it is a large charity gala or an office Christmas party, Eventbrite is easy to use and makes organizing very simple when accommodating guest preferences.",
Perfect for Planning Events,Jeffrey A.,Marcom Manager,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 06, 2018",4,5,4,4,4,10.0,,"Pros: Our company is constantly holding events for all our distributors around the US. There are a LOT of great features but the cost absolutely can't be beat. Other apps/programs/software have so many added fees for random features that it becomes an expensive hassle to even hold a single event. Not so with Eventbrite. We'd been burnt before with all the little hidden fees that it took some convincing the higher ups to get on board with Eventbrite. Now? They love it. Haven't looked back. It's an easy, hassle-free way to send out mass invites for an exceptional price. Just pump the link into an email and you're good to go. You can even have customizeable discounts and promo codes. I can keep going but I'll save you the reading. If you're using a different event planner, switch over. You'll get glad you did.","Cons: I don't like fishing for cons when there aren't any readily apparent, but if I had to say one negative thing about Eventbrite, it would be the customer service. You'll rarely have need to get in contact with them, but when you do it'll be a struggle. A few more reps, some more training, and an overall cheerier disposition would do them wonders.",,
"Practical Tool For Events, Not Without Flaws But Worth It",Alicia M.,BRIDGE Area Director,"Philanthropy, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 08, 2019",5,5,5,4,4,9.0,,Pros: Eventbrite makes setting up event invitations and ticket sales seamless for even an inexperienced user. Their template works for almost an function and navigating is fairly intuitive. Many people are familiar with Eventbrite so they're willing to go through the step of clicking into an additional link after reading about the event via social media or email.,"Cons: The customizations options are limited. There are not enough options to ask additional questions or gain event related information from the user. The backend data is not easy to access, use or transfer into other applications. While they are cost effective for small organizations, don't be fooled. The fees add up quick. Their per ticket cost is reasonable, but their credit card processing fees are high per industry average.","Overall: When it comes to the simple process of creating a ticketed and/or registered event, it can be done simply and quickly with Eventbrite. Customer service is quick to answer questions via chat or email. It does have limitations; however, without paying a subscription cost, it is still an industry leading tool.",
I would not recommend Eventbrite,Mary Lee C.,Writer and Editor,"Writing and Editing, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 20, 2019",1,1,1,1,4,9.0,,"Pros: While I do not actually like anything about this software itself, I do like that, although with considerable difficulty, it enables me to book online for events. I simply wish that events would use different software in order to achieve the same end result of allowing booking online.","Cons: I find this software unwelcoming and overly complicated to achieve a seemingly simplistic task. It is even difficult to sign in, and I am rarely sure, even after receiving a confirmation e-mail if I have booked correctly. As a result, I regularly waste time calling the event venue the next day, if a number is provided, to check that all details have been accurately received, and often (not always, but more frequently than I regard as reasonable), despite having received a confirmation e-mail, had I not checked with the venue, I was not booked into the event, which for events with limited space is, of course, potentially especially problematic. As a culture writer, attending arts events is an important aspect of my job, and it is a great time waster and strain whenever an event is done entirely through Eventbrite, as I must check anything possible and still be nervous that I will have trouble attending a sometimes necessary event.","Overall: My experience of Eventbrite has been very poor. It adds a great deal of time and worry to my working day whenever I have to use Eventbrite and follow up on it. Whenever possible, I avoid Eventbrite, and I have found that with some events and venues, while Eventbrite claims there is no availability, if one is able to circumvent Eventbrite and book directly, there is availability, so Eventbrite often seems a useless, even frustrating and counterproductive, unnecessary 'middle man.' I have had so many variedly negative experiences with Eventbrite, that recently, I decided for events that only book through it, if the event can be missed, it is more productive to not attend the event than deal with Eventbrite.",
THe best way to create an event,Natalia R.,CEO,"Telecommunications, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 13, 2018",5,5,5,1,4,9.0,,"Pros: I use for a long time Eventbrite for creating some events. Is very easy to use, export and manage all the things that you need.

With some clicks, you can create tickets and control your visitors.","Cons: To be honest, I love Eventbrite. Maybe that you can have more control about RRSS and the users that comment about your event",,
"Good solution for events, but room for improvement",Verified Reviewer,CEO,,Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"May 17, 2018",4,5,4,5,4,9.0,,"Pros: I have used Eventbrite for a variety of events now and I'm impressed by how easy it is to use, along with some great features like their built-in affiliate program and tracking capabilities.","Cons: The fees are fairly high, so especially for larger and higher priced events, this cost ends up being significant. I also wish it would integrate better with other mainstream software, like Hubspot - although you can create smart lists, you still need Zapier to transfer over attendee information.",,
"Great software, at a price",Mike R.,IT Manager / Web Developer,"Newspapers, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Oct 31, 2018",5,5,5,5,3,8.0,,"Pros: Everything Eventbrite does is spectacular. They make it beyond simple to create, manage, take payment, check-in attendees in their app, and receive payment. Even things that seem tricky like adding waivers to tickets and adding custom fields for additional data are extremely simple to use and access. Basically, everything just works as expected.","Cons: Now, with great software, I understand does come a price. However while their fee structure has changed over the years, I still maintain they are taking too large a cut of ticket sales. While the exact percentage does change based on your plan and the price of the ticket you're selling, we consistently see 30% or more of our ticket sales revenue go to to Eventbrite. Again I do understand that you do need to pay for great software, I just wish Eventbrite either took a lower percentage or offered a flat fee option.","Overall: Overall we are extremely satisfied with Eventbrite. Yes, I think their fees are too high, but in terms of actual functionality, Eventbrite pretty much does everything we need it to do extremely well.",
Eventbrite has been sent to me for small and large scale event ticket purchases.,Wendy M.,Nurse Practitioner,"Hospital & Health Care, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"May 18, 2018",4,5,4,2,5,9.0,,"Pros: The link to eventbrite is easy and user friendly. I like most that it saves your ticket information in a virtual wallet. It also tracks all your purchases. It has been a while since I acquired the app from the apple app store, but I believe it was suggested to download the app to mobile devise to have access to all the cool features.",Cons: The software always asks to use your current location. I have found that allowing access to current location can trigger the app to run in the background of you mobile device. This can also ping you for advertisements that are not wanted.,Overall: The app tracks my events that I have purchased virtually. This is helpful to keep track of events that where not solicited by the user but rather by invitation.,
Have been using this software for years.,Donald A.,owner,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jun 04, 2018",5,5,5,4,5,10.0,,Pros: Ability to sell tickets over a wide audience. Easy to upload mailing list. Helps maintain a customer database.,Cons: Fee structure and processing. Fees for events never remain consistent. And there should be a way for fees to be deducted at time of purchase as opposed to later via invoice.,Overall: easy to use ticketing software with html links.,
Handles registration without fuss,Adam C.,Assistant Professor,"Hospital & Health Care, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 02, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is very easy to set up and help organize registration for a meeting or conference. It has lots of functionality and control. For example, you can set special ticket type, make tickets available or unavailable at specific times/dates, set promo codes for speakers or discounts (e.g. for students). Payment processing is done by Eventbrite and then transferred electronically to an account you indicate. Fees are quite low and easily incorporated into ticket price (which you can choose to be visible or not to the end user). Very intuitive. You can be up and running in no time.",Cons: Eventbrite usually only pays out after your event. So if you are counting on the money from pre-ticket sales to be in your account prior to event - this is not the right option.,,
Because a party without people is just sad,Osa L.,Marketing,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 18, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: When you have an event or a cause and you need to get people's attention, you need to get people to come and participate, then Eventbrite is one of the easiest platforms you can use. Not only will your event be posted online, but it will also be easily searchable by google so that if people search for something that your event covers on google then your event can pop up. Better yet, people often go to eventbrite just looking for events to participate in, and when they see your event, they may decide to attend even if they were never even looking for your event.","Cons: Eventbrite has access to your contact list, and some people may not be comfortable registering with eventbrite because they don't want their information being too publicly available. In that case you can probably provide multiple options for registering for your event.",,
Eventbrite,Verified Reviewer,Marketing,"Education Management, 51-200 employees",Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,"Feb 06, 2019",4,4,3,5,4,7.0,,"Pros: - easy to use

- support for beginners (those who are using the software for the first time)

- free (if you have no event registration fees)

- great tool to have if managing simple events","Cons: - as soon as you create the event, it becomes public. I once had a speaker event created for my students (and it was a free event); and I had 3 external to school people signing up for it. Took me some time to go over the RSVP list to make sure nobody else external was there.

- not a very helpful tool if you event has multiple sessions/registration tracks/etc.

- very limited customization options",Overall: My overall experience with Eventbrite has been good. It is perfect for and easy to use when managing smaller simple events. It also looks professional.,

IT is easy, straightforward, and very accessible. The best feature is it is all online, instead of requiring one to leave home or stand in a line to purchase event tickets.","Cons: I can't think of anything negative. I would like to utilize the software at some point for an event of my own, but I will have to study up on how to schedule and promote through them.","Overall: so far, I have only purchased tickets through this technology, but I intend to utilize its awesome potential on future sales events of my artwork and writing. It is clearly the dominant choice for ticket sales and event promo.",

Only frustration is the inability to modify number of people in a booking without deleting it and starting again.",
Easiest way to get me to attend an event.,Olayinka A.,Intern,"Hospital & Health Care, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 11, 2018",5,5,5,5,4,10.0,,"Pros: I am one who is a bit disorganized ,thus on so many occasions ; I have been invited to events and I end up misplacing my invitation card and find it difficult asking the organizer for another.

Eventbrite has basically come handy for me. With Eventbrite ,I am able to register for events and get sent an invite to my mail. Since it isn't possible to lose my email account ,I never get to bother about loosing my invitation.As I am able to print it at anytime and as many times as possible.",,"Overall: Nothing ,it ticks all of my expectation and has never failed me at anytime.

I like that it is simple to setup for us and simple to use for the user. As a user, I have signed up for several events with no fuss.","Cons: Although I do love that it's simple, you don't have many options when it comes to design and making it feel like your brand. Other event companies we have used allowed for more customization. But really, in the end, people don't seem to care and a lot of our clients are used to this platform. They also recently changed their pay structure which wasn't as ideal as before but I imagine they had to make the decision as they were giving away a lot for free before.",,

Everything is self explanatory. There are lots of great events to pick from. Everything is organized and location is automatically set from your phone,Cons: What I enjoy least about this app is that not all events happening in the area are on here. That is about the only thing,Overall: I really enjoy this app. It has been ingrowing for the last few years and it has became into something really great. Everything is organized and put into whichever topic you may enjoy. Only downfall is that not all events happening in the town are on there but it is what it is. I highly recommend using this app for fun stuff. I have purchased many tickets off from it and everything is secure and easy to use.,

SO GREAT,Megan C.,Client Success Managere,"Marketing and Advertising, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Sep 07, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is so easy to use. I've never actually posted on Eventbrite, but I use it regularly. It's the best events site I've ever used. It's super easy to navigate and find cool events happening in my area. I've visited other event sites, but none of them are as user-friendly as Eventbrite. With other sites, my ticket always gets lost and it's SO hard to find it, but with Eventbrite it's always really easy to find.

If I see venues/performers/events using Eventbrite as their platform to sell tickets, I'm always more inclined to go because I know that purchasing tickets will be easy and hassle-free.","Cons: Honestly nothing, it's so easy to use and convenient.",,
Better than all the rest,Verified Reviewer,Client Success Managere,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Sep 12, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: I think Eventbrite is better than all other event softwares online. It's super easy, it integrates perfectly with Facebook and mail chimp. I use it will every event I create. The app for scanning tickets and payment is great. I can edit and create events with the mobile app which isn't great for on the go, plus it's practically free to use.","Cons: The only con I can across was Recently when I tried to update my tickets start and end date. I opened the Eventbrite app and was unable to edit ticket info, so I logging on directly to site from my phone and then I was able to make changes. Maybe there's a glitch or I don't know where to look",,

Once the event is created is is super easy to share, promote and keep track of sales. I love that I can use the software from my laptop as well as my phone using the Eventbrite organizer app.","Cons: Setting up an event can be tricky, especially if you are trying to set up more than one type of ticket, and it takes a little bit of time to get through to customer service if you need them.","Overall: We have used Eventbrite for 6 years to set up an annual event, and once we got past the learning curve on that first setup it has been smooth sailing! I love being able to login from anywhere on my phone and keep track of the ticket sales.",
Highly Recommend for Events!,Verified Reviewer,Paralegal,"Education Management, 10,001+ employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 18, 2019",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: What I really like about Eventbrite is how easy it is to create events. Whether it be a paid event or a free event, the whole process of creating and listing an event on the site and then getting people to register is an extremely seamless process. I have used Eventbrite to organize one school event and it was great because we were able to get a general idea of how many people we were expecting to show up!","Cons: There's definitely not a lot of ways that Eventbrite can get your event a lot of attention unless you share it on social media. For small events, this can be particularly hard to get attention from people that may not be in your immediate network. I think Eventbrite definitely needs to work on how to better improve how events can be promoted.","Overall: My overall experience with Eventbrite has been great and I would highly reccomend for others to give it a try. I know that whether it be a corporate or nonprofit, many other organizations have found it to be extremely useful as well.",

"After trialing lots of online ticketing agencies, I won't use anyone but Eventbrite",Christine F.,Director of Development,,,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 18, 2014",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: There are a number of reasons I prefer Eventbrite to other companies. Besides the required 'ease of use' and 'intuitive design' of their site I have to honestly say that I like all the controls the platform gives me. I can easily create different ticket options, discount codes, tracking links, invitations (which also allow me to invite attendees of previous events I've hosted on the platform) and can manually add any users (such as comp tickets for media) to the system without incurring any fees. I can also easily repeat an event with one click, which saves any custom tickets or pricing and also allows for easy updates. Their integration with social media is helpful, and they are always making updates to their offerings. They also have promotional tools to help you reach an audience outside of your usual base. The nonprofit organization I work for has conducted over 70 parties, tours, classes, etc with Eventbrite, and I consider them a partner in helping us produce great events and helping me raise money for our educational programs. I also appreciate that they are growing as a company. I never feel that their 'resting on their laurels' when it comes to the design of the site or the tools offered. Even after working with them for a number of years, I still call tech support to get questions answered if I can't figure it out quickly on my own, and their staff is helpful and nice. All in all I give them an A+. They make my job easier, and I would recommend them to anyone looking for an online ticketing company.",,,,
Best platform for attendees AND organizers,Verified Reviewer,Director of Development,"Education Management, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 12, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: Not many platforms have incredible functionality for both sides of the house, but Eventbrite is an exception to that. From easy to manage organizer features and reporting options, to easy to find events and reminders for when they're coming up, Eventbrite helps me feel connected to the places I am, and helps me connect with the people where I'm hosting events!","Cons: I wish there were some more page customization options, as well as date options (for example to let someone know that the event occurs across three days, each day 9-3, but that it's one event, not three separate events) has been a struggle for us.",,
Staying in touch with your community,Emily B.,Payroll Specialist,"Accounting, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Dec 26, 2018",5,5,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is the easiest way for me to see whats currently going on in my community in regards to social events. I live in the Miami, FL area and it has been a life saver when not knowing where to go with friends. The events are always well described and not too expensive. The app is also extremely easy to use.",Cons: My only con for Eventbrite is the fact that it doesn't have a counter for how many people have bought tickets to an events so you don't really know how big an event is til you arrive. I also know of a few friends that have bought tickets to a none existent event at a random location.,"Overall: Overall Eventbrite is a great way to stay in touch with your community and participate in all sort of events in your area, but you do have to look out for fraud and maybe look more into an event before buying a ticket.",
"Love the functionality, do not love the fees",Barb K.,Publisher,"Publishing, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 15, 2018",4,5,4,5,5,8.0,,"Pros: We love that we can use Eventbrite for all of our tickets to our various events. It's easy to set up, share, and track. We can also download our attendee list in order to email them through our email software. There are excellent statistics and information that we can use to compare events and year over year results.","Cons: The fees continue to increase, so on some ticketed events we only receive about 65% of the gross sales. The app only shows gross sales, so we have to remember to do the math to see our actual net income. We often pass the fees on to our attendees, but in some cases that inhibits ticket sales.",,

It is pretty easy to use and quick to set up. Payments are based on tickets sold, so you pay only if you sell tickets. Free tickets are not charged. It is possible to create different types of tickets, hide some special tickets (and give a special code to give the access only to some people) and create discount codes. I embedded the ticketing widget on my event website so attendees were able to buy tickets without leaving my site.",Cons: The fees applied to the tickets are a bit expensive. The confirmation email should have a customizable template to fit with my company's guidelines.,,

It has a user friendly platform, handles all payments/refunds, and has reasonable fees. Eventbrite has also become a go to destination for finding events to attend in my area.","Cons: It would always be nice to have no fees, but we understand that this is a necessary part of business and the longevity of the program. One time we had a problem with transferring of funds to our account after the event was over as they have set times they do this. It was semi-inconvenient but not a deal breaker.",,

I have used this many times during my time as a college student at Cal. Most events hosted by student groups at Cal use Eventbrite for ticketing. Our organization used Eventbrite to host multiple clubbing events in SF and to collect ticket sales. I enjoyed how there are referral links/codes to help track ticket sales from other organizations helping us sell tickets.,Cons: I did not really have a problem with the software. I do wish that there was more customizability for event pages though so it can really pop and stand out.,Overall: I enjoyed my experience.,

It's very easy to use and has great reporting, dashboard, etc. We are a member organization and would benefit from Eventbrite integrating with a CRM which it currently doesn't do.","Pros: Nice dashboard, easy reporting.",Cons: Customer service is hard to reach and sometimes it can be slow.,,

"Good name recognition, not the easiest to use",Liz A.,Associate Panel Marketing Analyst,"Internet, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 03, 2019",4,3,4,4,5,8.0,,"Pros: Eventbrite is one of the better known platforms for invites if you are hosting an event. You can set up alerts to automatically email your guest list reminders to RSVP, to attend, etc. It is easy to register outside users who may not have used the platform before.","Cons: Not always the most user friendly. It can take a while to figure out all the features, and can be tedious triple checking that all the emails are set up correctly. Emails can also be filtered into the wrong folders in many emails platforms.",Overall: I have used Eventbrite several times to send out invites for events I was hosting at work. It had the name recognition to keep people less than skeptical of the event.,
Eventbrite provides us free advertizement.,Oyinlola H.,Community Manager,Internet,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 06, 2018",4,5,5,4,5,9.0,,"Pros: At Stutern ,we regularly organize seminars for College undergraduates seeking internship positions in top companies across the country . Interested participants usually have to book a ticket for our event on eventbrite and this gives our company and events we organize a professional outlook .

Eventbrite also enable us make adequate preparations in terms of hall size ,refreshments etc for the participants coming ,by providing us with vital data like the total number of potential attendees for our event ,ensuring we are never caught unawares.

Lastly ,whenever we create free events on Eventbrite , random interested parties stumble upon these events by accident and book a ticket ,therefore I can say Eventbrite also gives us free adverzement.","Cons: Eventbrite limits the level of questions we can ask people to respond to ,before booking tickets for our events. Thus we are unable to ask conditional or tricky questions.",,

It has custom settings to choose from to create your own unique style for the event. I haven't used any other website since discovering Eventbrite!,"Cons: Truthfully, nothing! It satisfies everything I need in an event planning website.",Overall: Extremely satisfied! This is the only site we use to organize events and it's always a relief when local events are using Eventbrite because it is so amazing! It's easy to share the event over all social media platforms.,

They have both web and mobile application, which is extremely helpful. 2. I have used this app to book tickets during extreme rush. But It never let me down it did not crash 3. From user point of view, many organizers use eventbrite as a event management platform so I feel there is more viewers than any other applications 4. Lite UI in the mobile app. Do not slow down my mobile.","Cons: Its very difficult to find a con in this type of app which I weekly use and never faced any issue. Anyways, 1. I saw many times spam posting, specially in India. So I think posts should be more regulated",,
Eventbrite,Courtney M.,Manager Administration,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"May 25, 2019",4,4,3,4,5,8.0,,"Pros: Easy, easy, easy!",Cons: Dinged a few stars simple because the aesthetic of the templates could use an update. Would like to have a a the ability to add a little more customization.,"Overall: Due to the ease of eventbrite, it's a great option for anyone with events big or small. Set up is quite simple and the instructions are quite clear to follow. There seems to be a good number of folks who are already familiar with this systems which makes things more efficient all around. It won't disappoint!",

Its user interface is very intuitive and allows the creation of a smooth experience for users going through the event registration and ticket purchase process. The tool has advanced features which allow automation of event reminders, application of coupons, site embedding, and integration with google maps. I simply love this tool.","Cons: I cannot really point out any flaws with this tool's event creation functionality. It does a really great job in that regard, but one thing I do not like is that EventBrite has an event discovery feature, which lists other events listed on Eventbrite. I view that as a distraction for our end users as it can affect the attendance of our own event.","Overall: We use this annually to invite customers to our customer summit. As the person tasked with setting this up, I find the tool intuitive and easy to use. It offers me considerable flexibility in designing an event with numerous choices which make event set up real easy.",
Makes setting up event registration a breeze!,Lauren L.,Creative Coordinator,"Religious Institutions, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 20, 2018",5,5,4,4,3,10.0,,"Pros: I love that it's a one stop shop for event registration. You've got your professionally designed event page, guests can pay for the event right there, print their tickets, and on the back end there's an abundance of analytics, records, and receipts that I don't have to worry about because it's all there.","Cons: This is just a little thing (and might be fixable) but in the event dashboard, when I want to look at past events, I wish it went in the order of most recent event down than first to last. As we continue to add more events, I'm more interested in easily accessing analytics from our last event.",Overall: We have been easily able to set up a recurring weekly event registration with ease through Eventbrite. It probably took me 30 minutes to set everything up including payment options.,

You can find events happening today, tomorrow or within the next month. You can also search for events pretty much where ever you are and are travelling too. I also love that there's free events and very easy to rsvp to them. The website is very easy to use and everything is clear to see. The app is also very easy to use as well. I haven't created an event on there yet. But when I do have a need too I will definitely use eventbrite for my event needs.",

When attendees arrive at the site, they get a very professional presentation. Up until Cvents recent visual update, this was the best looking software in the game. It's also very easy to use. So if your staff are not experienced event planners, it's no problem! They could learn this extremely quickly.","Cons: I thought it was the best in the business, but it has a lot less flexibility than Cvent and Regonline. Eventbrite is based off of a ticketing paradigm. Since it's a ticket, some advanced options are not available. One problem we run into is that we apply discount codes. If you apply a 100% discount code (someone gets to attend for free, happens all the time), it will cancel the ticket! So then we as event planners have to go back in and re-register people or have them do it themselves. Customer service doesn't have any great solutions for this problem either.",,
"wonderful, interactive, creative displays",Hannah P.,Clinician,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 28, 2018",4,4,5,4,4,9.0,,"Pros: I really like how Eventbrite can connect event organizers and attendees so well. There are so many opportunities to interact with and message attendees, which is really helpful when there are updates. I particularly like how Eventbrite automatically sent reminder emails to attendees 48 hours prior to the event, with an option to download or print tickets.","Cons: Eventbrite works very well, but does seem a bit pricey in comparison to other similar softwares. I have never had a problem with Eventbrite, so I guess I am getting what I pay for, but I just wish it was not so expensive.",,
Changed and is now expensive for nonprofits,Grace B.,Director of Development and Community Relations,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 19, 2019",5,5,5,4,4,3.0,,"Pros: We liked that is walks you through step by step when creating events. With it being so popular, everyone knows how to use it too.","Cons: I believe in 2018 they changed their policy and are now taking a larger percentage of profits from the event. As a nonprofit event planner, the percentage they were taking from ticket sales seemed unreasonable. We encourage people to purchase tickets in advance because it helps us plan the event, but we were only getting about 80% of the ticket price and out donors wanted to know why so we switched to a fundraising platform rather than an event platform.",,
Easy of use,Giti Z.,Researcher/Graduate Student,"Higher Education, 501-1000 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 05, 2019",5,5,5,4,4,10.0,,"Pros: My school uses Eventbrite and thus, I sign up for events using this app. It is a simple app and very easy to use. When booking events, the app requests one to enter name, email and the number of people attending. There is no hassle. The booking is then confirmed and one can save the ticket and/or share it on social media. It has great features such as promoting, tracking and checking-in. It also offers a secure online payment option, which is easy to utilize.","Cons: Nothing I dislike. As an attendee to many events on campus, I can only talk about the features I have used. Thus far, I could not be happier with Eventbrite. It allows me to organize the events I would like to attend and have all my tickets in one place.",,

It is an easy tool to use to sell tickets and it is pretty straight forward to set up events on Eventbrite and promote them online and via email.,"Cons: The cost of using the service could be seen as a downside when there are other ways to sell tickets that are free (minus credit card or paypal fees). You also receive the fee and then pay Eventbrite, as opposed to the fee directly going to Eventbrite when someone buys a ticket.","Overall: Eventbrite's interface is clean and simple, and figuring out how to customize your event listing is fairly easy. It is also easy to go back in and edit and event. You can export all the registrations into a spreadsheet for easy check in for ticket holders. Eventbrite also helps boost your event because of the search engine optimization and Eventbrite's own tools. Eventbrite will recommend events based on your region or social contacts, thus encouraging more registrations. Yes the service is not free, but it is worth the cost and saves time in terms of registering people and promoting your events.",

You're able to see all that we're invited to the event as well as those who: declined, will attend, or a maybe.

If you have an iPhone, and you choose to attend the event, it will save in your calendar automatically.

It also syncs up to your maps or Waze for directions.

It's like a mini prep for anyone you may not want to see.","Cons: There are no cons with the software.

I prefer the old fashion way of mailing out letters. Times have changed and so I too must change.","Overall: I love it. I haven't had any negative things to say about Eventbrite.

Making Events Great Again,Verified Reviewer,Co-Founder,"Education Management, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Sep 10, 2018",4,5,4,4,5,8.0,,"Pros: A few things. It is pretty easy to set up; in fact, it's kind of hard to screw it up! The whole idea of ticket distribution and money collection is taken care of quite nicely. I can also easily see how many tickets have been purchased, who has purchased, everything that you need in an easy, simple dashboard. I have used it in a variety of settings with never a problem.","Cons: Occasionally, creating event posts leads to nowhere. Once or twice, I've had issues with adding in location or editing the description, that sort of thing. Considering the payout and distribution is seamless, it's a pretty small price to be for that. I think my issues may have been more of an anomaly.","Overall: The collection of funds and the ease of registration make it well worth it. The old-fashioned way of hard tickets at the door is cumbersome for large events - this tells me what I need to know well before the event begins. I also love anything that collects data, such as addresses. Use it, for sure!",
Popular for Good Reason,Sarah Ruth O.,Projects Estimator and Account Executive,"Construction, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 17, 2019",4,5,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: I like that this software is so often used in my area for small events like little workshops to large scale events like music festivals. I like that it feels like your getting tickets to something more private in contrast to ticketing software that is so publicly viewed such as Ticketmaster. I like that this is software that any person can use to get work out about their event, it gives it a very ""local"" feel.","Cons: Given the nature of the local-feel, if you are simply pointed to the site because you have an event you want to go to and the link to tickets leads you there, its great. But I think as a standalone app, its not an excellent choice for browsing events as a lot of the ones that turn up are not narrowed down by interest as much as other apps in its category.","Overall: I notice that all of the local events in my town use Eventbrite for their ticket sales -- they tend to be small music venues, dance nights, classes, workshops and similar.",
Known,Nachi S.,Head Personal Development & Life Coach,"Health, Wellness and Fitness, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 11, 2019",5,3,3,5,5,7.0,,"Pros: In a world where one doesn't know what website will rip you off or is a trap waiting to scam your credit cards, I know eventbrite is a reputable source. That is a pro of the application. Their navigation system of looking for events seems fairly intuitive as well and if one is having a casual browse, the app does well in serving that.","Cons: While surfing the application casually can be easy, if one is looking for information in a pinch about an event, it can be a little difficult to find. Many events have to create special rules outside of the app in order to work around what the app lacks.",,

You can invite people and create a space for information. It is widely used among many businesses. It is easy to find information and RSVP to events you are invited to, and it allows syncronization with Google Calendars to automatically add the event to your calendar.","Cons: As an end user, Eventbrite can be confusing and cumbersome. It also feels archaic and restricted to web. I am unaware of any mobile access or app for the service. It also has a reputation of being very business heavy and does not lend itself to social gatherings outside of business.",,

It's easy to see and participate in upcoming events related to your interests. It is also nice to be able to share your views after and before the event as a participant. Thanks to Eventbrite's reputation, as a community administrator, you can easily incorporate many people into your community on any topic.","Cons: It needs to have a free version, especially for non-profit organizations and schools. Many communities are being shut down for lack of financial support.",Overall: I use Eventbrite to keep track of events of interest to me and to build communities. It allows me to meet many new people and establish new collaborations.,

I like that it is live data, every time someone registers you are notified and can maintain headcount for multiple purposes whether to ensure you have enough food or to see if you need to cancel and reschedule the event based on the progression of the registrations.","Cons: No con with using this software, I think its user friendly for the most part. However people can collect money for events doing other traditional methods but this cuts out that extra step. You can register and pay at the same time.",,

It's very easy to do, shareable","Cons: If you are a paid event organizer with over 1000 attendees, you will have to pay (+2.5% of every ticket sold) for the use of the tool, and that's a lot of money! There are other better alternatives to Eventbrite with a cheaper rate. You can find them in Capterra too!",,

My company also uses the platform to find useful events to go to for Project Management, Marketing or IT events. It is a great team building option and sort of cheap considering many events are free and provide refreshments and snacks. We have also used it to promote our company events and the reach is great, depending on the topics it is even better than social media.",

The easiest event software out there!,Verified Reviewer,LPN,,Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 26, 2018",4,5,4,4,5,10.0,,"Pros: My company plans events all around the world. As a result, we've tried out pretty much every event software out there. Eventbrite is by far the easiest there is to set up, use and manage. It especially makes the event easy the day of, as their app and swiping ability let us move long lines quickly.","Cons: For our more complex events - especially ones that have multiple lodging options - there's just no way to set them up how we need using Eventbrite. As such, we have to use multiple event apps, depending on the complexity of our event.",,

As a charter school we used this product for two years to promote and gather registrations for our golf outing and Run/Walk/Bike events. It did what we wanted but the fees just became too much. We have moved to another product with less frills appearance wise but actually more features that has saved our school significant money over Eventbrite.,Overall: The product was good to work with but it seemed like every feature we needed to add was more off of our profit margin for events that we could not afford to lose.,

They have some great integrations and it's so simply to setup an Eventbrite page. An added benefit is their promotional channels they use to send info out to local email lists about upcoming events. It's essentially free publicity.","Cons: Eventbrite is great for free events, however their rates are a bit high for ticketed events.","Overall: Overall, I really enjoy Eventbrite and definitely recommend it for free events.

You can set up a great event page and sell tickets in a matter of minutes.,,Recommendations to other buyers: Eventbrite is one of the easiest event management tools I have come across.

It's a great resource, you can search for events local to you and in categories to suit, we work with young people and check this site regularly to see if anything is happening locally to us that would be good to attend to learn and network with like minded people.

The platform to design the event and set rules and ticket specifications is incredibly simple and having a built-in guest list function is great for managing all the names and +1s for guests. The ability to also collect emails to notify attendees of event information is very useful.,"Cons: If you're using Eventbrite for paid ticketing the 3.5% + fees rate can seem a bit hefty, especially if you're passing it along to the consumer to pay for. Unfortunately, this is a reality of buying tickets online where the fees tend to stack up pretty quickly.",Overall: Eventbrite is my go-to solution for any small to medium sized event. I have nothing but praise for how simple Eventbrite makes the entire event process.,

Eventbrite pages also integrate with Facebook, so you can still share and market your event seamlessly! I enjoy using this website b/c my clients receive my call to action (you're invited, please RSVP), without having to pay for a ticket (if I choose), but they still go through the steps of signing up for a ticket, hopefully giving a greater sense of commitment and obligation to attend, vice just clicking ""yes"" or ""no"" on a FB event, which is highly noncommittal.","Cons: I haven't yet mastered how to keep an event private but still have it come up in searches on Eventbrite. I wanted my clients to be able to search for the event (in addition to having the link, you know - cover ALL possibilities), but the only way I could make my event searchable, was to make it public - open to all.",Overall: Highly satisfied! Eventbrite is a regular tool for me as a business owner!,
Great Marketing Tool,Fernanda D.,President,"Marketing and Advertising, Self-employed",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Oct 24, 2018",4,4,4,5,5,8.0,,Pros: Is a great marketing tool that you can use for free as a start. Really easy to use and if you want more features you can pay for it so you can use more of their resources.,"Cons: The free version gives you limited usage and if you want help, you have to pay. But other than that, is a great tool for marketing. 100% recommended.",,

The emails that were sent looked professional. I was a happy camper using this software. I believe the cost is very fair.,
Works great,Zac R.,Interaction Designer,"Design, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 18, 2019",4,5,4,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: I like that hosting a free event is free on the platform. The process for creating an event is straightforward too. I also like the flexibility, although limited, in branding an event. It's also great for tracking and communicating with RSVPs.",Cons: I dislike having the system create tickets for every event no matter what. We've hosted events before that we wanted an rsvp for but we didn't need people to show tickets to attend. It made it confusing for them and more frustrating than it needed to be for us.,Overall: We publicize events and gather rsvps for attendance.,
Initial Impressions are Positive,Jack H.,Creator,"Marketing and Advertising, Self-employed",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Jun 26, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,"Comments: I've not really run it through its paces, but after my initial use, I'm willing to continue to use it.

It's easy to create the event and to create a great looking landing page with the tool. I like the options it provides for specifying and then tracking the number of tickets claimed. It seems pretty easy and intuitive for the user on both desktop and mobile platforms.,"Cons: I hate the fees charged for ticket handling. But I don't know any way around it. I haven't done a paid event yet with EventBrite, but the fees look to be the typically outrageous ""handling fees"" that ticket brokers charge. I accept the reality that these folks aren't working for free, but it is really irritating to see a 10% or even 20% premium added to the cost of the ticket for ""surcharges and handling."" Yech.",,

The software is super easy to navigate, and as soon as you launch the home page you will be greeted with tons of info about upcoming events in your area, and around the country. If you download the app its a quick process, and a good place to store your tickets that have already been purchased, which helps if you are an eco-friendly person and want to cut down on paper usage.","Cons: I don't have any qualms with the technicalities of the software, I think the color of the app is eye catching, but I wish that there was more of a pronounced design on the app, from an artists point of view.",,

The fields are well organized and I can preview my event at any time. I like that I can share access to registration information with the people in my company hosting the events. It's also nice that I can limit their view to only see the data they need.,"Cons: Eventbrite is fairly limited when it comes to events that are more complicated. For example, we are planning an event where attendees may choose from dozens of workshops in multiple different time slots. This is not easy to do with Eventbrite.",Overall: Eventbrite is easy to use and makes setting up events a quick and painless process. I like the easy way to process payments as well! Use it.,

It is very easy to use,Annette G.,Assistant Manager,"Retail, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Jun 27, 2018",5,4,5,5,4,10.0,,Pros: It is very easy to use and advertise any events to local people. Having contact information on file and one-click emailing makes it way easier for people to get in communication with me if there are any queries,Cons: I cannot think of any negatives for eventbrite except that advertising is kind of little expensive for every ticket as there is % + per ticket sold price + credit card processing fee which makes it to about 20% but it is worth it for the advertising we get,,
"Great product, but most intergrations don't work in Australia",Caitlin P.,,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: GetApp,"Aug 01, 2016",4,4,3,1,4,5.0,"Comments: Great product, ease to use and set up events. Inter rates with mailchimmp and Wordpress relitively easily. But if your in Australia you automatically loose out on over half the intergrations available. None of the NFP charity intergrations are good if your outside of the US, Canada is the exception to this rule with a few providers. I enquired about some of the new features they have been aludding to recently on their website, Particularly fundraising intergrations for event participants to collect sponsorship for their event, well customer service was quick to help but despit stressing I was from Australia and they would need to be able to offer their services here but also except an Australian Charity status, they just referred me to intergrations that did neither . Over all great product but feel like I'm missing out with the intergrations.","Pros: Easy to use, setup or booking.","Cons: Intergrations are only for the US, forget about using any of the NFP if your not from the States.",,"Recommendations to other buyers: Basic events, great.

Great Way to Host an Event,Verified Reviewer,,"Computer Software, 51-200 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: GetApp,"Sep 25, 2018",4,4,4,1,4,9.0,,"Pros: I like that Eventbrite is very user friendly. The options are all laid out for you and thought through (such as charging tax, promo codes, etc.). This tool works really well for my company because the event we host annually for our users is less than 100 people, so Eventbrite is an easy, somewhat cheaper option for us.",Cons: There aren't many options (at least with the subscription we have) to design the look of the event page. Eventbrite also limits things like number of ticket types you can have depending on your subscription. The reporting tools of past events are a little limited/confusing as well.,Overall: Works for what we need it to. I'm excited to see how our customers interact with our upcoming event on Eventbrite!,

It even sends out reminders prior to the events. Is is app friendly so you can scan the tickets too. And, it's a great way to collect client contact information for mailing list too. Some software can be so overly complicated and Eventbrite didn't do that. They gave you everything you needed, for free, in a very intuitive setup.",Cons: I did not have any dislikes about this software. It was incredibly easy to use.,,

Helpful Way to Share Event Information and Track Responses.,Jennifer O.,Chief Publishing Officer,"Publishing, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jun 06, 2019",4,4,4,5,5,8.0,,Pros: It filled the need we had to provide easy registration links (and maps etc.). We don't require tickets or payment for the events for which we use it. We like that our target audience recognize the name of the software and trust it to RSVP. We also like automatic reminders it sends to those who have registered,"Cons: We did run into some confusion last year for our series of choral reading sessions where the same person was registered multiple times, causing us to expect a larger crowd than actually planned to attend. We assumed it was a user issue -- that they planned to bring a friend or two but chose not to provide specific names. However, it was actually a system glitch. As we use the free version, there was a little bit of difficulty at first when trying to get the issue resolved, but their support team was ultimately helpful.","Overall: It works well for our registration tracking needs, provides easy-to-share links, and sends helpful reminders and directions to attendees.",

We use Eventbrite for ticket sales on one event every year, and I wouldn't use any other system. It's easy to customize how tickets are issued and easy to refund tickets. No problems whatsoever. I had some questions, and called customer service once. I was so relieved to speak to someone and get the problem figured out immediately.","Cons: I wish it was a little bit cheaper with its fees, but they gotta make a living!",,

"Better than most even management platforms, but not the best",Verified Reviewer,Writer and Marketing Coach,Higher Education,Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 09, 2018",4,3,3,5,3,6.0,,"Pros: This platform is one of the most used event platforms, so the user experience (for ticket buyers) is simple and easy for them. Building your event is easy and enables you to create a launch an event within 10 minutes. It's great to use for small sized events, but for larger events the payout process can become a pain. It has great widget items that you can embed like a countdown clock or ticket buyer.","Cons: The new embed feature they use is not compatible with all CMS. If your CMS does not work well with iFrames, you'll have to do 4 extra steps in the creation process in order to use the classic embed code. The map of where the event is located can be glitchy and not show up at all. If you're using the free version, you payout is sent after you event has occurred unless you can have support change it without a fee. There isn't an Eventbrite Wordpress plugin, which would be great as well.","Overall: - Simple to use

- Seamless user experience

- Safe to use for transactional functions

- Great support with great follow through",

In addition, Eventbrite will help you collect money for registration, register people at the door and market your event to the public.",Cons: I wish Eventbrite would take their money from the payments directly vs the user having to return after an event and pay the final bill. Just seems like an extra unnecessary step.,Overall: Cost Value - Their cost is spot on and its one of the best event registration and marketing tools out there.,

That said, they handle all invoicing and payments, etc, for a pretty fair fee structure.","Cons: They offer reporting on nearly everything, which is great. That said, it's not super intuitively organized, so I've, on multiple occasions, had to search around for specific data points before I found them.","Overall: Overall, I think their service is awesome and handles almost all of the administration for hosting both free and paid events.",
Consistently a fast expereince,Verified Reviewer,Student,"Information Technology and Services, 11-50 employees",Source: GetApp,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Feb 07, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: The only reason I breath a little sign of relief when I am trying to rush through an event sign up is when I see it's been created by eventbrite. I know that the fields can be autofilled and the event confirmations are easy to find later. I used to attend a ton of meetups and events, while it was never too difficult to get signed up. Often the whole process of entering the same data made we want to quite by the second field. It shouldn't take me half an hour to get through this because I'm looking for spending the least amount of time possible. It's been seamless and fast in my experience.","Cons: I once tried to use the platform to find local events that were in my area... that was a mistake. The groupings are difficult to navigate, many events were completely off, the locations I was searching in weren't displaying in a map format, etc. This software isn't for discovery as much as it is for confirmations and organizing.",,

This platform allows me to do so very seamlessly. Since I work for a government agency, all software that use must be free, so this work out perfectly.","Cons: I do not like that I can not add my companies logo (or perhaps I have not figured that part out). I would like the option to personalize the event page as much as possible, but all for free since the agency I work for does not have a budget for this type platform.",,

We use Eventbrite for small events of 10 or so attendees, medium sized events of 50-80 people and large complex, expensive events.","Cons: Eventbrite doesn't have a ton of flexibility when it comes to designing the main page of our events. They do allow us to add a custom graphic or photo, but there are limitations to other parts of the look.",,

Makes tracking ticket sales and attendance super easy. We've been primarily using it for free events, so that's a perk as well.","Cons: It can be a bit complicated to set up different ticket types so there is a learning curve at the start. We don't host a tonne of events on EventBrite so every time we do, we need to refamiliarise ourselves with the process.","Overall: Has really made it easy to post events and coordinate ticket ""sales"" - how many tickets are left, cancellations, waiting lists, etc. Easy to promote on social media.",

It is very easy to work my way around the website, whether searching for an event(s) or if I am clicking an link that's taking me right to a specific event. The payment process through Eventbrite's website is also very cut and dry and simple to use.

You can easily add different payment options for your customers and even add descriptions for what the different options get you. It's great for everything from a golf outing to a simple free event.,"Cons: They take a percent of your ticket sales for operations. Yes, I know they have to operate - however, it would be great if their cut wasn't so high. For me, its a major turnoff when it comes to selling tickets for a high pricepoint. Might be better off looking at other platforms if you're actually selling tickets.",,

I think the product is extremely easy to use, and I never had to ask for help on how to use it.",,Recommendations to other buyers: I think that you should definitely consider it for your small events.

I like that I can use it to find upcoming events, such as, conferences, seminars, networking and do forth. It also can be used to promote your upcoming event(s).","Cons: I think one thing Eventbrite can do is get their events SEO'd on web browsers. It would definitely help entrepreneurs gain more attendees and help Eventbrite, too.","Overall: Overall, I've used it for years to either locate events in the area, to promote an event and to research.",

Over all, good experience.","Cons: Eventbrite's service fees, etc. are, in my opinion, a little steep to make sense for most small events. They do provide a lot of value in streamlining the ticket-buying experience for a guest, so it may be worth it.","Overall: We were happy to use Eventbrite for a couple of local music events selling less than 1000 tickets each. Which the fees were steep, they are for any ticketing software.",

This is your platform,Verified Reviewer,Performance Marketing Manager,"Writing and Editing, Self-employed",Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,"Jan 12, 2019",4,4,5,3,4,8.0,,"Pros: It's free for organizers to use as long as your tickets are free, otherwise they charge per sale which is similar to other platforms where you sell stuff on. It integrates with just about EVERY other platform, social media, website, etc which is crucial if you want to get your event out there.","Cons: The fees can be a little much if you're a smaller organization who's trying to get paid but not overcharge for your tickets, however, they are industry standard prices.",Overall: Decent.

Curate your professional events without a custom written app,Verified Reviewer,Engineer,"Education Management, Self-employed",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 29, 2019",3,4,3,4,5,8.0,,"Pros: I've been using Eventbrite on and off for many years. As an attendee for conferences, I sometimes loathed having to install the app on my smartphone yet again. UNTIL, I went to a conference that decided to write their own app for attendees. It was a disaster. The custom app was buggy and pretty much featureless. That's when I realized that Eventbrite is the de-facto app to help curate and organize a complex event for attendees. Everything from tickets to itinerary listings, it does reliably and comfortably. It's easy to use for most people who are not tech savvy, while giving some power users some settings to tweak with regards to reminders and ticket/voucher organization (Apple Wallet, etc).","Cons: You might only use Eventbrite a few times a year, but it doesn't stop it from trying to invade your ecosystem with integrations and email subscription. It's easy to untangle and unsubscribe but it can feel like a hassle sometimes.",Overall: Just install it on your smartphone. You're going to use it eventually. And don't even think about trying to be trendy by writing your own app for your once a year event. Just use Eventbrite and enjoy the service that's tried and true.,

It allows you to use your phone as the actual ticket! this is definitely the golden age of technology.",Cons: I was expecting it to show more concert dates for some of the smaller acts. This may be a limitation of the data and not a reflection of the app itself.,"Overall: Overall, I can see this app going even bigger than what it is now. Possibly even being bought out by apple music. Who knows. But for now, it's very reliable and works like a charm.",
Great option when you don't want to pay for a huge ticketing software program!,Verified Reviewer,Remote call avoidance,,Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 20, 2018",4,4,4,5,5,10.0,,Pros: Very easy to set up and to sell tickets. It doesn't take long at all. Even someone with no ticketing or event experience can go in and easily figure out through the step by step instructions and info to fill out. More budget friendly than having to get a contract with a large ticketing company!,"Cons: I wish you could have more control at tailoring the interface (fonts/colours/etc) to your needs, but that isn't a huge con. Fees can be a bit pricey for those with very small businesses or non profits.",,

It's a simple way to collect data and share information in one place. I like that it's not connected to another platform (i.e. Facebook) so it feels more open to many users. You can collect payment through it as well, although I haven't used that feature as an event planner.","Cons: You're still using someone else's software, but I feel more in control with Eventbrite than I do with some of their competitors.",Overall: Planning and attending events.,

For the latter I probably use the site at least once a week. And for creating events I've used it once with no problems - it worked flawlessly for selling tickets and organizing attendees.,Cons: The percentage-based pricing will hit some ticket tiers harder than others.

Tickets can be on mobile device or printed out. Automatically sends ticket confirmation.",Cons: It appears the website automatically changes to a different language (ex. from English to French) if you search for events in a location that uses a different language (ex. somewhere in Quebec). I would rather have all the page options stay as the original language and only the event name is in another language.,,

The best part is some customization is possible in the free version too and the Eventbrite App works smoothly on smartphones.",Cons: Managing events with a larger crowd is not a great experience with Eventbrite as importing and downloading information becomes complex. Attendee list can be viewed only after linking to a Facebook page and something like connecting to LinkedIn could be preferred as it would be more professional.,,

It's also easy to cancel registrations and access a list of attendees.,"Cons: The skin/theming isn't as customizable as I would like for it to be, in order to match the theming on event pages.

Not everyone uses Facebook, so an invite here is better sometimes.","Cons: With all freebie software platforms there are advertisements, it's just annoying sometimes frankly.

Often conference registration is really cumbersome, asks for too many details and has too many pages. EventBrite seems to only ask for just the basics which is fine by me. I get a ticket on my phone and then that's it - I just pull it up when I arrive at the event. I don't have to print anything out beforehand - I just show up and show the ticket on my phone. Very easy experience.",Cons: I can't think of anything.

Eventbrite is very well designed, so it is very useful to understand how the things work. The best of Eventbrite is that is free when your event is free! So when I'm organizing a free conversation or conference i know Eventbrite is the best solution to distribute my entrance tickets. Even when is a paid event, Eventbrite only takes the 6% as a commission for the sell and it give me an event page to promote the event and an app to control the sales.","Cons: It could be amazing if Eventbrite implements more payment methods (I know you can use Debit and credit cards), that could be useful in no banked countries. Sometimes people prefers to go and pay physically what they buys.",Overall: You can organize and sell your tickets for your next conference or class.,

Bringing events to your computer.,Verified Reviewer,Marketing Manager,"Legal Services, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Nov 26, 2018",4,2,3,2,3,5.0,,"Pros: I like the fact that you can just set-up an event if you're organising one. Everyone can sell tickets for their events and that's a good thing, makes your event available to a large audience so you could probably get more visitors by putting it on a website like Eventbrite.",Cons: When you are selling tickets you will have some trouble solving everything. I remember having a lot of trouble with changing events and the available tickets. Had to wait a long time to get a response from their support aswell.,Overall: Overall I like the idea of Eventbrite and it somehow works decent enough. (at the side of customers buying tickets the site is perfect and you'll have your tickets immediatly in your mailbox after paying). But from a seller's perspective I think they could've done a way better job at making it simple and easy to use.,

The fees are reasonable and we've never had a problem.,"Cons: At first, we found it a little difficult to link Eventbrite to some of the other software we use, including our website, so that people could go to one place for registering. Eventually, we got the hang of it, and now there's no problems at all.",,
Great event registration site,Valerie T.,Graphic Designer,"Hospital & Health Care, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Nov 03, 2018",5,5,3,5,4,9.0,,Pros: I like Eventbrite b/c of the way it integrates with social media. I can set up my facebook event page and have the option for people to buy tickets right there without having to be re-directed back to eventbrite. That is super helpful and makes us look really professional.,"Cons: I don't like that you can't really customize your event page. I think that was a recent change b/c you used to be able to manipulate colors and fonts for the page, but now the colors automatically generate based on your event header image.",Overall: Eventbrite has been a great tool for selling tickets. I like that you can send email notifications to all or just a portion of your registrants. You can easily keep track of tickets sold and manipulate those controls.

Even if you are a small business or an individual looking to book for an event. It sends out automatic emails and reminders, tracks your ticket sales, and embed events right onto your website.",Cons: I would say the only thing I think would be cool is if you could white label this service somehow so Eventbrite's name didn't show up.,,

Eventbrite is efficient and super easy to use. It makes life simple in our digital world where mailing invitations is no longer favorable. The Eventbrite softwate helps me get an idea of the event turnout even prior to the event through rsvps/tickets sold, which in turn helps me prep to host/serve a number guests accordingly. One option I enjoy using on Eventbrite is keeping the location as TBA, and releasing the event location info only to those who plan to attend.",Cons: I have no complaints about the Event software.,,

With a little bit of time, a user can easily set up both paid and free events. I've hosted multiple events with this software and it's relatively painless to process payments and update the event.",

I have mainly used this to purchase concert tickets and I usually see that the ticket prices stay stationary rather than fluctuating like other ticket or even websites. 10/10 recommend.,Cons: Something Eventbrite along with most other event ticket selling platforms should really work on is the emphasis they should place on people who are ordering a LOT of tickets at once. There tends to be a clear trend in scalping tickets especially for events in small venues.,,

It made keeping track of the RSVPs and attendees so simple! I was able to export excel sheets with every person who confirmed they would assist, plus the fact that the reminders are sent out automatically and (at least) a paper ticket can be requested for the person to show on their phones or download them, makes them remember about the event even more. When you host a free event it is possible for a lot of people to forget about it or disregard it more easily, but when they have to take the time to download the ticket and so forth, it is more of a commitment. The add to calendar feature is also very very handy.","Cons: Not sure if this is offered (it sure must be), but a pay option with no Eventbrite branding would be perfect and if I use it again I would be glad to purchase it.",,

This website is really unique and easy to use and is truly a killer of boredom.","Cons: The only thing that I can think of that is a con of this software is that you can't ask questions about the events online. I think the site would greatly benefit from some type of forum for each event where people could ask questions and have someone who knows about the event answer them. My girlfriend and I have found ourselves wondering things like what kind of clothes to wear or what seating would be like with many events, and have not been able to get those questions answered.","Overall: Experiencing things that I never thought about and didn't know existed. Seeing Dallas, TX beyond just the mainstream stuff. Never running out of options for things to do on the weekend.",

I love that I can use it free of charge, I can email everyone to invite them , and it will update me and track who has responded and who hasn't.

Since Eventbrite is also searchable, it can expand your event's audience as well.","Cons: It isn't set up to create more complicated event ticketing, such as selling group tables at a charity gala. That's not really what it's intended for, though, so that's understandable.",,
Event Registration,Maritza K.,Owner & Founder,"Management Consulting, Self-employed",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Software Advice,"Mar 15, 2017",4,4,4,4,5,8.0,"Comments: For the registrant the process is seamless, however, Eventbrite could improve their backend experience for those putting on the event.

We used this software to advertise our job fair events. This software allows us to send mass communication to applicants in our ATS informing them about our event and asking them to RSVP for it. It has made the events easier to manage because it gives us an idea of how many candidates we can expect to attend by allowing them to select time slots.,"Cons: The only thing I do not like is that it allows our applicants the ability to select multiple time slots for our events. It would make more sense to only allow them to select one time slot. Allowing the candidate to select multiple times with multiple tickets has inflated some of our numbers, which can be misleading because we think more candidates are going to attend than actually will.",,

You have to create a new account on the actual event page, and then you can link it. That part should be more clear. Beside that, I haven't had any problems.","Overall: It's great to work with. Very easy to setup events. We do a lot of free events, but some paid, so the fact that it's super easy to switch between the two is great.

If you don't have the technical know how to build your own registration website and database eventbrite is a great solution. Their infrastructure has allowed our events (both free and paid) to function quite well. Integration with mail chimp was also very useful,"Cons: The one size fits all approach that they have works for the most part, however when organizing an event with several tracks and different components and registration options it became quite cumbersome to set up and manage, and one envisioned portion of the event needed to be slightly changed as we could not figure out how to make registration for that component work (we ended up taking registrations in person at the event for that portion so it all worked out). I also feel that Their customer service could be more responsive","Overall: It was definitely an asset to the organization of the event, despite the small bumps in the road",

It clearly stated on the tickets that there would be a person there to check you into the bar crawl until 7pm that day at the Asbury Ale House. I arrived at the Asbury Ale House at 6:30pm and there was no one there to check us in. We got no wrist bands and no sombreros or whatever we were supposed to receive. I asked the bar tenders and hostesses at the Ale House about it and they informed me that the person running the bar crawl left at 5pm! I couldn't believe it. So, I did my own bar crawl and lost money to a stupid company that didn't give me anything I paid for. Then to go further I filed a claim with my bank to get the money back because I emailed Event Brite and they didn't respond. Go figure. So, the bank gave me a temporary refund and I just got a letter in the mail today that says they are taking the money back because Event Brite basically said they won't give the refund.

My NYE tickets were paid to my account on Jan 6th 2015 but Eventbrite claimed it on the 2014 1099 form. (My accountants loved that)!!!

Also wondered why my bank statements and 1099 form didn't add up??

Apparently they 1099 you on the fees they keep as there own service charge!!!!

Customer service couldn't even tell me that. My accountants had to figure it out on there own.

Did over 150k in ticket revenue with them last year. They will get $00 this year..

Check out Ticket Tailor. (This is not a plug) look for yourself. They have flat rate fees that are pretty reasonable in my book. And much easier to justify come tax time!!!
