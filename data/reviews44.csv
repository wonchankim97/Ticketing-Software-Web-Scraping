ticketbud,Easy to use and any questions I had were promptly responded too. Can't ask for more than that.,Eric D.,Reunion Coordinator,Printing,Used the software for: 1-2 years,nan,Source: Capterra,"Jun 26, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Site was easy to use. They gave me the money just days after tickets were bought so I could pay venue, DJ, Photographer, etc. The customer service was excellent. I'd email a question in the morning and would get responded to that day if not within just a couple of hours. The getting the money before the end of the event, which is what another site was doing, allowed me to have a fund to make payments and I wouldn't have been able to do the event otherwise.",,"Overall: Being able to get money in my account to make payments before the event, instead of just getting a bulk payment after the event.",

ticketbud,Good SquareSpace calendar option,Annabeth H.,Director,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Dec 08, 2015",4,4,nan,5,nan,nan,"Comments: I started using Ticketbud because the SquareSpace calendar does not currently allow recurring events. It was very easy to embed the Ticketbud calendar into the library's SquareSpace website. So far, I'm finding Ticketbud intuitive and easy to use. There are a few enhancements I'd like to see, but overall I'm happy with the switch. I called for help and also used chat help and both times was helped quickly by professional and competent people.","Pros: First of all, you can get an actual person on the phone, and pretty easily.

There was in other words no ""repeating event"" option for calendar entry. Enter Ticketbud to save the day (and weeks, and months, and years!! :-) There were clear instructions on how to do this actually on the Squarespace page, and we are delighted with the results. I am quite new to this kind of thing, and have had questions come up, but Ticketbud's customer service have been prompt, courteous, and knowledgeable. We are very happy to have found them and recommend them highly.","Pros: First of all, you can get an actual person on the phone, and pretty easily.

Being a user who doesn't have advanced tech savvy skills, the site was pretty easy to navigate and offered multiple great ticketing and info options that we could customize for our event. It was wonderful to use a service where you could easily contact a REAL person and get REAL help, right away.
