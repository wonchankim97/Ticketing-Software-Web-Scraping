We wanted to replace several out-dated technologies and instead use one software for our internal operations.",Cons: EventBank's all-in-one platform has few shortcomings that I can think about and it has meet our expectations.

eventbank,I got through my first event and realized I needed a different platform once completed,Verified Reviewer,Deputy General Manager,"Entertainment, Self-employed",Source: Capterra,NO,Source: Capterra,28-Jun-19,4,3,2,2,5,10,,"Pros: It was easy to set up the registration page and ticket options. Somewhat customizable. Check in was standard. Reporting is descent, can download excel spreadsheets for specific ticket types.","Cons: 1. The top con on my list would be the payout process. Being that my events function based on ticket sales it's important that I have access to funds more frequently then twice per month. Other ticketing systems will pay you out every few days. I ran in to an issue where I needed to pay my instructors, venue and other staff but didn't have the funds available, so I had to front the money out of my own pocket.",Overall: My overall experience was much better than my previous with using other softwares my only gripe was what i mentioned above. If those 4 issues can be fixed then I'd say it's a great platform but for now I'm going to be finding another option.,

Additionally, Eventbank designs and maintains our primary website which provides members and users with a high end look and feel.",Cons: My dislikes are minor (i.e. more member to member engagement features),"Overall: My overall experience has been extremely pleasing and time saving. Time is of the essence and we need to work fast in today's business environment, Eventbank allows me to save time and get things done much quicker due to the fact that many features of running a day-to-day business are built into one portal.",
eventbank,Eventbank were our ticketing partner for the 2018 St Patrick's Day Irish Ball,Martina H.,Administrator & Ticketing Manager,,Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,24-Apr-18,5,5,5,5,5,10,,"Pros: The software was easy to use, provided up to date information, allowed for the creation of reports with detailed information and the Customer Support provided by Eventbank was great, all queries were dealt with in a timely and professional manner.",Cons: The only con was the inability to create tickets for a full table as a back end user.

The volume of workout 'events' that we do per week has increased drastically, and with EventBank we've been able to go from a rag-tag group of volunteers to a much more organized and efficient planning group. As a grassroots movement, this kind of tool is amazing and essential for us to be able to keep doing what we love, but do it better and better.",
eventbank,"Very effective platform, with more to come",Graham N.,Communications Director,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,7-Mar-17,5,4,4,5,5,9,,"Pros: The look and feel, and the potential to manipulate the data.","Cons: It has been a struggle to iron out the complications in the CRM, but it gets better all the time.","Overall: EventBank has some excellent features that make the chamber's work much easier. Their background is with events, and their platform provides a lot of features to help make the set-up, promotion and registration easier for us and the participants. For me, the e-newsletter system stands out - it used to take us weeks to put together a new email newsletter, but now we can do it in an afternoon. It also helps us collect a lot of data about the effectiveness of campaigns.","Recommendations to other buyers: It offers a lot of functionality, and they add a lot of functionality, so you'll need to keep playing with it to understand all that it can do."

A large step up from our previous CRM and Event Management systems, Eventbank has a user-friendly interface that is easy to use and navigate - either through exploring by yourself or through the help of their tutorial videos. Furthermore, in the CRM module, individual contacts and companies are seperated for easy access, and the Member companies are contained in another module of the CRM.","Cons: Some of the features unfortunately we have been unable to use due to legal requirements in our jurisdiction - including to our chagrin, the invoicing feature. While it is near impossible to find software that is going to meet exactly every need of every organisation without creating a custom-made solution, Eventbank is open to suggestions and their team have been very supportive and happy to take on board any suggestions or needs that we have had.",,
eventbank,All in One Event management system for our community,Vy V.,Community Manager,,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NO,Source: Capterra,18-Apr-18,5,5,4,4,4,8,,"Pros: We use the platform for 35+ events a week across 2 cities and at present we manage over 4000+ members.

We are able to easily set up events for our community to access and register for, regardless of indoor or outdoor sessions and numbers allowed.Easy administration for efficient review, publishing, check in process. EventBank works seamlessly along side our other information platforms, giving us more visibility.",Cons: We created a 'how - to - use' PDF for our community to easily use the platform as we had users downloading the managers app instead of the users app.,,
eventbank,Good all-in-one platform for social organization,Laurine B.,Marketing Coordinator,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Capterra,17-Apr-19,4,4,4,5,5,8,,"Pros: She Loves Tech is a global platform committed to empower women in tech.

As a small team, we couldn't afford to waste time working with out-dated technologies and Event Bank provided what we needed.",Cons: We encountered minor bugs while using the registration and mail marketing functions.,,
eventbank,Productive now that we have Eventbank,Matthieu B.,Regional Manager,,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,10-Mar-17,4,4,5,5,4,10,,"Pros: With Eventbank, I can onboard new organisers smoothly and delegate them exactly the rights I want. It's simple to create personalised and professional designs for our event pages. Sharing on social media and their payment methods are all smooth and straightforward.","Cons: They could provide more analytics, drive some traffic from their own audience and offer more features to design their event pages.","Overall: We have tried many ""popular"" services in China to sell tickets to our events and it is clear that they don't know their industry. Eventbank clearly made the effort to think from an organiser's perspective rather than click bait standpoint (or least effort required).","Recommendations to other buyers: Go for it, absolutely worth switching from the existing players in the market"
eventbank,EventBank as a great software for event management,Andrea R.,President,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Capterra,27-Feb-19,5,5,4,5,4,9,,"Pros: Very intuitive to use. Offers many automatic functions like ticket sale, payment and confirmation, as well as email reminders to participants. Offers diverse design templates and functionalities that can be customised. Great customer service. Served us not only for organising the event but also for promoting the event through detailed event descriptions, speaker bios, sponsor page. Offers an app for both event managers as well as participants. Very easy to track and manage ticket sales and registration lists.","Cons: We used EventBank with an umbrella page for a complex series of 11 events in 8 days and 8 different venues. The complexity tested the limits of the software in terms of flexibility and customization. Not possible to show more than one venue. Also, not possible to link iCalendar to specific event but only to entire 8 days nor to disable this function. However, this degree of complexity is certainly an exception for events managed by EventBank software.",Overall: We didn't use it as Membership Management Software,
