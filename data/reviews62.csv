nutickets,Good customer service and an ever evolving product,Matt C.,Theatre Manager,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,nan,Source: Capterra,"Dec 07, 2016",5,3,3,5,5,9.0,,"Pros: - It is robust enough for the general public to use with ease.

- It is fit for purpose and offers a cool customer experience.

- Some features like the app and scanner are excellent

- customer service is good and their staff want to help","Cons: - The software lacks a controllable reporting feature. Most theaters do box office splits and disbursements and so there should be a way of inputting this and downloading reports to this effect.

- The marketing features would be better if they were integrative with other products such as post planner.

- A little more admin control over the system would be good, it is sometimes a little restrictive and prescriptive",Overall: Nutickets were an alternative software for our theater after find out-out that our present system didn't do what we required. After a few calls and chats with the team at nutickets we were up and running. We have been with them for 6 months now and our contact at nutickets does keep us in the loop and solves problems for us.,Recommendations to other buyers: Good piece of software with some very cool features. Good customer service and it's heading in the right direction :)

No nu ticket app for the back office side",Overall: Nutickets have been a massive help to starting my brand.Rep & his team do really bend over backward to help and progress your event. I'm not going to milk it tho there is some little ideas I've sprung that are in the road map to coming on the platform which I fully understand. Rome wasn't built in a day. Can't recommend these guys enough.,"Recommendations to other buyers: When the event is capped at 500 it should work side by side with the tickets on sale. For example maybe a slider option to put tickets on/off sale because when it shows how many are left, it's not how many up to the 500 it's how many you've put on sale. Ticket template info box never keeps the data. I have to write the info every time I put a ticket on sale."
