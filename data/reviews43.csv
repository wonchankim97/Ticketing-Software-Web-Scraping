ovationtix,Great Service for Patrons and Companies Alike!,Meredith S.,General Manager,"Entertainment, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,nan,Source: Capterra,"Sep 21, 2016",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: - Sales Format is customizable to match your website, so customers don't know they're going off-site to purchase their tickets

- Easy to add packages, products and donations to the offerings

- Easy to set up numerous shows and events throughout the year and share access to box office information to select individuals for select productions

- Ability to track all donor activity, including donations, attendance at shows, and product purchases (such as Auction wins or merchandise sales)

- Ability to sort donors by category or campaign

- Ability to have multiple donor campaigns for multiple projects

- The online format allows our Development Staff to work remotely when necessary because all donor information is on the cloud","Cons: The ability to track pledges and offset them with donations is still in development. We'd like to be able to track a donation for its intended fiscal year, but that feature is not currently available. It would also be nice to be able to track Grant Deadlines and activity, as one can do with some of the more expensive programs.","Overall: We've been using OvationTix since its inception. With dozens of shows throughout the year, including many for which we function purely as Presenters, the functionality of OvationTix has been crucial to our success. Our presented productions can monitor and see the success of their shows, and we can manage the overall process. We enjoy working with OvationTix so much that we began using it to track all of our donations years ago.","Recommendations to other buyers: It's the best, most affordable and client-friendly ticketing and development software out there!"
ovationtix,"Perfect! Stellar support, intuitive features, scales with us",Steven M.,Manager,"Entertainment, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 6-12 months,nan,Source: Capterra,"Feb 27, 2017",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Ease of Use

Quick Set-Up and On-Sales

Integration with Email and Website Platforms

Great Support

Helpful and Ongoing Upgrades

Call Center for Ticket Buyers by Phone

Private, Custom Branding

No Up-Front Cost: we only pay OvationTix when we sell tickets.","Cons: We aren't a non-profit company, so all the fundraising features in the solution don't really apply to us. This is not a complaint really, but those tools are probably of great use to other companies. We just don't use them.","Overall: Our events perform in multiple venues with varying set-ups: assigned seats, general admission, and with various types of tickets like VIPs and student pricing in venues from 99 seats up to 800 or more seats. We also use discount codes, want something that easily integrates with email software and our website and really responsive support since we produce more events than our relatively small staff can handle! OvationTix has worked very well for us in this first six months of our partnership with them. I like that they update the software monthly with new features. It is important our company keep its branding consistent and OvationTix makes that process seamless.","Recommendations to other buyers: Get trained on the software! It is really intuitive anyway, but training is free and you can get a lot more out of it early on if you and your staff get formally trained. It's all by phone/webinar and easy."

It is also flexible, so we can adjust it to our needs as an itinerant company. We can make our subscriptions customizable to each space that we are in.",Cons: The reporting function is not as straightforward as I would like. Sometimes it takes some extra finesse and creativity to pull a report with the exact information that you need. It is not as straightforward as a database as it is a ticketing software.,"Overall: Overall, Ovationtix is very easy to use and client friendly. They have a great support team that is easy to reach and very helpful. For a small company such as ours that does not have a stationary box office, their phone line is a great way for us to offer box office service to our patrons. It's online functionality, allowing us to use anywhere we go, is great, as we are an itinerant theater company, and need to set up a new box office area for each show, somethimes in areas that are not as conducive to a theater environment.","Recommendations to other buyers: Love ovationtix.
