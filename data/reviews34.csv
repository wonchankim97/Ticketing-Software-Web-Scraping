giveffect,The best fundraising software available!,Stephanie S.,Chief Development Officer,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 201-500 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Apr 18, 2017",5,5,5,5,4,10.0,,"Pros: It's so easy to use. The capacity of this software improves about every 2 weeks when they release a new update to the system. It's grown exponentially since we started using it about 2 years ago. They now provide amazing resources: training video tutorials, webinars, a Facebook group page to network with other users, etc. They just keep upgrading the system and adding new features so regularly, I truly believe Giveffect can literally do anything you need it to.","Cons: Nothing really. The only downside for us is the price. Honestly the price is a great value for what you get, it's just a little high for smaller non-profits...but you can literally do everything you need to.","Overall: Before Giveffect, we were using BlackBaud Raiser's Edge, and no one in our office could use it well. Just to learn how to use it, our employees had to pay a large fee and go to a week long training seminar. It was not convenient, and that knowledge was lost as employees turned over. I managed to figure out how to use it myself, but wasted a lot of time. Training others on my team was next to impossible. During the initial demo, we could tell that Giveffect was leaps and bounds ahead of Raiser's Edge. With Giveffect, the software itself is very intuitive, and the provided free training video tutorials and webinars are really helpful. Even before those resources were available, it was so easy for me to just start using the system. I've since been able to set up my entire team using the system, and they've had few to no difficulties learning to use it. Our focus is now on building better relationships with our donors rather than fighting with a system to enter gift information. Giveffect has been absolutely wonderful for our team.","Recommendations to other buyers: It has so much potential. The integration with other services is really nice, i.e. mail chimp for email marketing. They've recently added auction software, you sell event tickets, donate button on your website, volunteer management, literally everything you need."
giveffect,Giveffect.com Review,Kris H.,Office Manager,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 1-10 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,VRI,Source: Capterra,"Mar 03, 2017",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: Giveffect has consolidated our process for us and eliminated the need to use multiple platforms. The time savings for our staff has been huge! Also, the ongoing training opportunities, customer support and ever evolving aspects have been incredibly helpful and have allowed us to make our processes even more efficient. The software is also very intuitive and easy to use/understand. In addition, the team at Giveffect actually listens and evolves the software based on the growing needs of users and the clients we serve.",Cons: I have yet to have a negative thought about Giveffect.,"Overall: ""By switching to Giveffect we have eliminated having to use multiple platforms to function. Everything was separate for us before and we basically were spending a ton of time moving between software, platforms and systems that didn't communicate well together and/or did not allow us present the look and feel of our agency. With Giveffect we can easily accomplish all of our tasks from one platform AND on the front end of things it integrates seamlessly with our own website! From the get go, Giveffect's customer service has been top notch - they've had an answer for every question we've had and their team is readily available whether it is through their online ""Chat with Us"" feature, via phone or via email. They also do an amazing job of listening to feedback and the needs of their clients then turning around and implementing updates which allows them to offer all of us a continually evolving solution. I can't even begin to explain the amount of time we now have available each day to focus our energies on the important stuff - the kids in our program and our mission. Highly recommended!""","Recommendations to other buyers: I would encourage you to call those using the software for references and also TRY the demo! We did both of those things and haven't had one regret. Our biggest hangup initially was the migration to a new platform, but their team helped us handle this with ease. It seems to good to be true, but it is so worthwhile."

Giveffect was more expensive than what we intended to spend, however we felt like we were getting more for our money to bring so many processes under one roof and I was absolutely sold how the back end of the system talks to the front end. Saves us a lot of work every day, and also provides a higher level of accountability.","Recommendations to other buyers: Get the highest level, it includes a super simple and beautiful drag and drop website tool that we love, lower credit card fees and the ability to add alot more users."

We felt eTapestry was antiquated and was not updating their service to keep up with the times and our needs. This is when we started looking at new software that could be a home for our data and our fundraising campaigns.,Cons: Minor bugs here and there that are addressed quickly. Duplicates not auto removed. Would love to see auto capitalization added when users add their own info in.,"Overall: I looked at a lot of different systems and spent a long time trying to decide and they mostly had too little functionality.

giveffect,We've used GivEffect since Dec 2015. It is the easiest CRM/fundraising software I've ever used.,Melanie K.,Chief Development Officer,"Fund-Raising, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,VRI,Source: Capterra,"May 01, 2017",5,5,4,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: It's so intuitive and easy to customize to your needs. There are no tedious forms to fill out to change or add fields, you can do most of it yourself. The campaigns are so easy to set up and easy to promote. Once your staff is familiar with the user experience troubleshooting is incredibly easy to manage. Donations come in with little to no issue. The team is so incredibly responsive and if we need something done differently it's almost always made available on the next upgrade. The tutorials are quick and painless to sit through and you can access them whenever you need to. Their webinar series is great and they do a wonderful job of keeping us up-to-date regarding changes, new functionality and upcoming tutorials and training.","Cons: There are a few pieces that are only available in the upper tier, which is a bummer. Also, the number of administrators we can have is limiting. The cost to add what we need is probably as much as moving to the next tier - which is slightly higher than we're prepared to pay right now.","Overall: Makes my job so much easier. The ability to customize letters, communications, campaigns saves me time. Also, it makes segmenting donors incredibly easy so that communications reach the right people at the right times.","Recommendations to other buyers: Get the highest level, it includes a super simple and beautiful drag and drop website tool that we love, lower credit card fees and the ability to add alot more users."

I also love how a single donor can be viewed from multiple dimensions -- as a volunteer, major gift maker, and direct mail donor, etc.","Cons: My organization struggles with slowness on Giveffect, regardless of which computer we are using. Additionally, there are many functions we'd appreciate more development on. We submit feedback very often, but our suggestions haven't been implemented yet. Hopefully it improves over time!","Overall: About a year in to our service with Giveffect, we trust our data much more. I pull reports every day and can rely on their accuracy. Our satisfaction with the software has gone up and down, but because of the efforts of their customer service team we are the happiest we've been to date.

It was all in real time. You can run a report and see it right there on the screen. I also like the birthday campaigns.,Cons: Sometimes there were options in the reporting tables that needed more training. But it worked out that chat support can help.,"Overall: ""We had a vital need for improvement in our online giving system and Giveffect delivered. We were not able to access important information before to ensure accuracy, but all of that has changed by switching to Giveffect. Also, combining volunteers and donors was a difficult and cumbersome process for us, we used pen and paper to gather information for our volunteers and members.

We had our reservations about it not being as simple as the demo we saw, being too difficult to transfer our database (which they handle by the way!!) and so on, but at the end of the day what they were offering to us was an efficient, effective and an up-to-date platform so we took the leap.","Pros: I like how the software has components to serve volunteers and donors alike.

We can see a contact's page and be aware of the events they attended, donations, contact information and basically have a 360 degree view of the person. There are tools in the system to help us build relationships with interested individuals.","Cons: The software has what appears to be multiple reporting efforts from queries to formal reports, but queries are never consistently working and we tend to only use one to two of the formal reports and manipulate the data in excel. It is much more manual than anticipated.","Overall: Giveffect works to update it's system and add features regularly. It is helpful and encouraging knowing that the system might change, but although it is a great tool to track building relationships there are a lot of areas that need improvement to reduce time spent collecting/gathering data for my company.","Recommendations to other buyers: Get the highest level, it includes a super simple and beautiful drag and drop website tool that we love, lower credit card fees and the ability to add alot more users."

Every time I get an offline donation, when I log the cheque into the database, I could see our supporter's whole history. I could see if they volunteered or donated in the past. It's the main thing our Habitat really appreciates about Giveffect. I can thank them and say, 'Thanks! You gave and you volunteered at our construction site or our reStore!' It's fantastic that I can do that so easily and make each message so personalized. We've been using the ""Letter Template"" to print out ""Thank You Letters"" super easily. I just log the check and print out the letter and - 'I'm like, ok I'm done!' Even when I hand off the donations that I've inputted into the database to our finance department for our auditors to see: A) what donations I've entered, B) what fund I assigned the donations to - it's so easy for them to put import data into Quickbooks.

This year we used Giveffect, 420 volunteers raised $267,000. We fundraised about the same amount with 130 fewer students! We found that Giveffect's ease of access and use increased the funds we raised per student - up about $150 more compared to what they had raised with Kintera Sphere. I truly believe that if we had the same number of student volunteers fundraising this year, we would easily exceed $300,000.

giveffect,We love Giveffect!,Cherise D.,Special Events Manager,"Non-Profit Organization Management, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 01, 2017",5,4,4,5,5,10.0,"Comments: Last year we used Kintera Sphere, 550 student volunteers raised $268,000. This year we used Giveffect, 420 volunteers raised $267,000. We fundraised about the same amount with 130 fewer students! We found that Giveffect's ease of access and use increased the funds we raised per student - up about $150 more compared to what they had raised with Kintera Sphere. I truly believe that if we had the same number of student volunteers fundraising this year, we would easily exceed $300,000. While Giveffect doesn't have every single feature that Kintera Sphere has, we quickly realized that we didn't need every option. A lot of the functions they had were very cumbersome. Simplicity is key.",Pros: Extremely user-friendly.
