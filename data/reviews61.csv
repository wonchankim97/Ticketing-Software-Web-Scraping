Once it is loaded, you can access multiple links for access to your event from different venues, such as website, Facebook, Twitter, electronic newsletter, etc. It's great!","Cons: I struggled a bit with the proper language to use as a nonprofit organization.

They handle everything. And, they provide periodic email notification of the progress of your ticket donations.",
