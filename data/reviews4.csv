SAP's platform for the future,Verified Reviewer,Bookkeeper,,Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 08, 2018",4,4,4,3,1,10.0,,"Pros: Started using HANA 5 years ago with v1 SPS5 back when it was just released for SAP BW. Back then it was ""only"" an in-memory DB. With each new SPS release, HANA became better with more DB features integrated. Fast forward to today, it is a full-fledged database platform with enterprise features that rival (and in some cases) even bests Oracle, MSSQL, DB2, et al. For customers who intend to use SAP for the foreseeable future, you would no doubt have HANA already as part of your existing if not future SAP roadmap, given that support for the traditional DBs is until 2025.

SAP HANA, which is re-written from the ground up to fully take advantage of today's modern hardware, supports multi-threaded CPU architecture, use of terabytes of memory to run its in-memory database capabilities, columnar & row based database with full-fledged compression, full support of PL-SQL and many other application components.

From a hardware perspective it is a 2-horse race with the commodity Intel x86 platforms becoming more powerful with each CPU iteration and better CPU core-to-memory ratio support, and IBM with their Power-based CPU architecture. As hardware prices continue to fall and become more powerful, it is only a matter of time before HANA hardware becomes truly commoditised.","Cons: Today SAP HANA is not only a competent database platform, but also is a very robust applications platform. As HANA continues to grow its feature set naturally there are more bugs as a result of a multitude of features. Development of SAP HANA is also diversified across multiple locations around the globe (Walldorf, India, etc.). SAP must do a better job in responding quicker to customers with issues.","Overall: Must-use for all SAP customers, given that it is critical to SAP's success as an enterprise software company.",
All in one & easy,Leah P.,DB Admin,"Management Consulting, 11-50 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NO,Source: Software Advice,"Nov 07, 2017",5,5,5,3,1,10.0,"Comments: For an all in one suite ERP, this is the best. Although some areas are not quite as robust as some would like, SAP really nailed it with this one. They address a huge span of customers with the one product, which is completely customizable if you want to spend the money. However, most of the time, companies find that they can walk with the product, no customizations for the first 6mos. Then they get a good feel for what they want to change.","Pros: SAP took all of the knowledge gained with ECC, B1, etc. & published it into this cloud solution. You buy the license, and you have access to all modules. It is not a new charge to add in Project Management for example. You just turn it on. Online help documents are outstanding, and you can literally learn the entire software functionality by following them. With it being a cloud solution, you get auto updates every 3mo, which is nice. It updates some of the default government fees, for all of the countries you have in your system. Expense reporting for example. There is very little administration needed to let the software flow once you turn it on. And the best part is that you just need internet to access the software.","Cons: It is for mid-size businesses. So for larger organizations, the licensing can get pricey. There is a limited amount of knowledge in the field on the product, so it can take some time to get answers for some topics from the partners, or to find info online.",,
Everything is done for you!,Leah P.,DB Admin,51-200 employees,Used the software for: Less than 6 months,NO,Source: Software Advice,"Nov 15, 2016",5,4,5,4,1,10.0,"Comments: I have been working with this product for almost 2 years now. Most of my knowledge is self-taught from the online documents. This system is as robust as you wish it to be. The thinking has been done. Language packs, which apply in all modules, Country-specific financial rules that are updated constantly (IRS Guidelines for Expense Reporting for example), auto calculations, multi-currency use within one transaction. A counter part in Germany can operate in German, while all of mine can be in English when I am troubleshooting their issues, I think is outstanding. SAP is constantly updating, they have a great team backing the product, it is very personable user experience in my opinion. We use it for Order to Cash. We use the Supply Chain set up, full Financials. Production of Materials, Purchasing, Customer Service, just not POS. Although it has the ability, our business does not operate that way.","Pros: The process is built in, it is native to the operation of the system. SAP's been in the business long enough to be able to take all of the success from Enterprise ERP applications that they have built, and merge this into an online application. The product is very versatile for what I would think many styles of business. I personally enjoy the idea of not having to program the system to react a specific way, I work through the process in a test, using the online documentation, some time with an SAP Partner (Consulting Company), but the hours spent there are little. We also have the additional SDK, so we can write some personalization to the product if we wish to. The SAP Support tools are wonderful, there is probably too many resources to reach out to.",Cons: Not available in HTML in the production environments yet. Some users have been testing out the HTML in the test tenants. It is completely different layout. We would love to be able to drag & drop attachments instead of having to browse to them.,,"Recommendations to other buyers: I personally would recommend this product to anyone looking to upgrade or start out with an ERP / MRP. This tool is very robust, you can bring on one module at a time, and all different implementation partners know what they are doing, as SAP validates their abilities first. This is a very well-thought out product."
"SAP Hana is a memory data platform that accelerate the business processes,deliver process inteligene",shaik a.,Associate Software Engineer,201-500 employees,Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Mar 12, 2018",5,5,5,5,1,10.0,,"Pros: The best multi combination platform that are driven with data platform and as report generation tool. Best part of this software is it removes the burden of maintaining any additional system to hold our data it acts as 2 in 1 which holds and generates output results.so that we can run live and make better business decisions in the new digital economy.The features are like reduce its complexity, we can run this any where and can give accurate and real results some more additions operations it include are Transform data management,Process data in memory,Leverage advanced analytics, and can develop advances applications. Best storage as well as analytics based software that stores in Idoc data presentations",Cons: The SAP Hana was very least thing to say because it is very best in tool for holding large massive data and its generation of the reports but we requires additional changes in the page layout and design of the SAP lOGON need to be changed and immediate password change assitance need to be required. if they implement this software will be very more useful,,
SAP HANA provides an in memory database for fast data access and processing,Richard C.,Maintenance Mechanic,"Automotive, 51-200 employees",Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 06, 2018",4,4,4,4,4,8.0,,"Pros: I like hat HANA is in-memory computing technology that provides an in memory database for fast data access and processing to users. Properties like faster data fetching, quick execution times, speedy access to external Apps make it a very useful technology. The business problems being solved with the product are as the data volume grows, the conventional database based reports and processes tend to slow down. This at times negatively affects the year on year trend analysis and processes requiring multiple data fetch. HANA, being in memory database virtually eliminates these issues. The data fetch is almost instantaneous and the processes run much faster.",Cons: I see nothing negative about the technology in itself. The roll out of this platform could have been done in a better way. The cloud integration of SAP has been slow as well. These I thing that can be looked into,"Overall: I what find is that since SAP is firmly sticking with in memory computing and making all of their processes compatible with in-memory computing. This eventually forces customers to migrate to HANA but the user experience in HANA is much better compared to the alternate in my opinion. This is recommended for any SAP customer with large volumes of data that needs processing, reporting and analysis. I would recommend with training",
SAP S4HANA makes the company run faster and effecient,Anil S.,Head IT,"Utilities, 1001-5000 employees",Used the software for: 2+ years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 06, 2017",5,4,4,5,4,8.0,,"Pros: Architecture, Performance, Adaptability and Easy to use Interface",Cons: A better price is desirable.,"Overall: Inox Air Products has upgraded the SAP landscape to SAP S4HANA. Performance issues of ECC 6.0, challenges in adapting new technologies and sap innovations, moving to user-friendly interfaces and business analytics propelled us to adopt S4HANA. The vision from management, especially our director, to move the organization processes to next level by digitalization of business processes. We needed a solid technology and platform, on which we can digitalise and scale. Adoption of FIORI solutions for better user experience with workflow and to build analytics is a major reason for moving to S4HANA.

ANALYTICS AND ERPS - WHAT BUSINESSES NEEDED,Verified Reviewer,Head IT,"Computer Software, 51-200 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Oct 04, 2018",5,4,5,5,4,9.0,,"Pros: 1. The data processing speeds are greatly improved on the HANA platform. This is due to the in-memory technology incorporated into the system.

2. Very easy to set up and integration with SAP is almost flawless. This is especially true with cloud.

3. The user interface is not only eye catching, it also incorporates analytics which enable the users to create interactive dashboards, graphs and widgets.

4. Since it is a database in itself, which supports data to be stored in columns (as opposed to the previously used MS SQL, which stores in rows), it allows for faster data processing, analytics and more efficient storage of data.

5. It allows a company to monitor key KPIs.

6. In terms of security, it is very efficient. It relies on encryption, patching and best practices when it comes to security. It is also linux-based which provides a very secure platform","Cons: 1. The hardware and software specifications required to run HANA may be unavailable to some businesses hence if a company wants to use it, the would have to acquire them.

2. The dashboards and some of the analytical features are unavailable on mobile.

3. While customizing and writing stored procedures, one must be very careful as the application is linux-based hence it is case sensitive.","Overall: It is very reliable, fast and efficient. It has enabled many companies to streamline processes and access a myriad of information related to their companies in real time",
A step into the future.,Verified Reviewer,Head IT,201-500 employees,Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jul 24, 2018",5,5,5,5,5,10.0,,"Pros: SAP HANA, or Netweaver over HANA DB (HDB) is a step into the future. Before this concept of in-memory computing and memory storage (without reading the disk all the time), some reports took very long to load. Now you can get access to a larger piece of data in seconds. HANA also brings BW to another level of real time reporting, even detailed information can be shown in no time, its very fast. The way we build views by using the HANA Modeler is very simple but yet powerful, you can do a lot with little knowledge and much more with some expertise.","Cons: The tools used to work with HANA are both the HANA Studio or Eclipse with SAP HANA plugins. In my opinion, it could be better than it is; with more components, less bugs (you have to restart the environment every once in a while) and a better explanation about how the aggregation you see has been formed (Simpler than PlanViz).","Overall: With SAP HANA, my skills in view calculations have increased, I have another point of view about how to create one type of report or another. It is also very productive and very fast response. In addition with other tools like SAP Lumira, Qlik View / Sense and Tableau you can get a nice result, it leverages BI to another level and makes your experience even better.",

It has BI and CRM, that surpasses the traditional ERPs and with Hana accounts with very good operating performance.","Pros: SAP Business ByDesign is an ERP very easy to use, to implement and that allows to have 360º information of the whole company in real time. It is very easy to learn to use by the end users. It has very good integrated BI reports. It's the beautiful SAP","Cons: SAP does not do much promotion to the product, to success stories and not much is known about its strengths in what the cloud managed by SAP itself. I consider the ERP's weakness in advanced manufacturing functions, in the management of mass purchases and in the capacity of large batches of information.",,
Awesome product,Arun M.,Analyst and ERP-Coordinator,51-200 employees,Used the software for: 1-2 years,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Jan 25, 2017",5,5,5,5,4,9.0,,Pros: Flexibility and artificial intelegence,"Cons: For me, the learning did take little time. Learning materials were not made available online (public) Not sure not it is made public or not.","Overall: First and foremost is - I always wonder how they could cover all possible scenarios in one single application.

This is a massive creation by SAP which makes all enterprise runs smoothly.

My experience with SAP ERP was very good. Below are some of them,

1. Navigating to different screens was easy

2. The shortcuts provided for each screen navigation as well as field/option navigation was very great

3. Various types of reporting facilities was again one another big feature of this.

Reports such as: accounts payable open items, cash reconciliation, cash - open items, payment monitor, and supplier account information are easily generated and always accurate","Cons: -When entering invoices with many lines in SAP, calculated tax amounts for each line sometimes changes as I add more lines in the invoice. Software sometimes has trouble calculating correct tax and gross amounts for invoices when multiple lines, cost centres, GL accounts, tax codes are entered

-As I enter invoice items while entering an invoice in SAP in the view all screen, I'm unable to enter a credit memo line item. To do this I'd have to go back into basic view, enter the credit memo, then go back into view all.","Overall: - Overall SAP is very efficient, reliable, and user-friendly",
Best software for process workflow management,Verified Reviewer,Junior Accountant,"Research, 11-50 employees",Source: Capterra,NGC,Source: Capterra,"Apr 03, 2019",5,3,5,4,5,9.0,,"Pros: The multi-dimensional utility of this software for various departments is the most fascinating feature. It can be used across the board ranging from shipping/receiving, planning, manufacturing, quality assurance, quality control and testing, payrolls, and administrative services, to name a few.
