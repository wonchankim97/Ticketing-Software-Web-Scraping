- Options for real-time reporting are head and shoulders above what we had with our previous ticketing system.

- Completed ticket pages LOOK great - very attractive to our potential customers.

- Options for collecting donations, memberships etc in 'one stop shopping' is a fantastic feature.","Cons: - Fees are a bit higher than our previous supplier - mainly because our previous supplier had a non-profit rate for fees, while Elevent does not.

- Because there are SO many options for customizing tickets, the learning curve for our team has been a bit higher than anticipated.

- I don't like the fact that we have to rent Elevent scanners and can't just use our in-house devices to scan tickets.","Overall: Streamlining our ticketing, more advance ticket sales (with early bird discounts, too)--because it's so easy to use",
