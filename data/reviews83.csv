ticketsage custom solutions,We Love TICKETsage,Trish H.,Box Office Manager,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Sep 30, 2009",4,4,nan,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: The absolute best thing about TICKETsage is their customer service. When the system was first implemented last summer, with our season tickets being printed and mailed from our office for the first time, we needed to depend on the staff of TICKETsage heavily. We came into the office on the weekend to print the tickets and were on the phone with TICKETsage support multiple times during the day. Since then, anytime we have the slightest problem, we are very comfortable calling (in an emergency) or emailing (if the situation is not dire) TICKETsage support. They are very prompt in returning our calls or email.

The day to day operation of the system is easy to use and dependable and it is pretty much impossible to ""mess up"" an application as the system almost always has you confirm or apply an application after it has been changed. The staff at TICKETsage is friendly and helpful even for us ""non-techy"" computer users.","Cons: The TICKETsage system has a lot of features that we do not use to the full potential. They seem complicated and confusing, although after a year of day to day use, I am becoming more comfortable with trying to solve problems before I call for support. Occasionally (maybe 3 or 4 times in the past year) there has been an error that needed to be fixed at the TICEKTsage end of the system. Only once in the past year did the system ""go down"" and was off-line for 15 or 20 minutes.","Overall: Overall, we LOVE TICKETsage! The few problems we have had are completely over shadowed by the great things about TICKETsage. I am sure that if we had the time to schedule a session with TICKETsage, they would be more than happy to help us learn how to use the features that we do not fully use and the reports (and there are many) from which we, thus far, have not been able to gather information. I'm sure it's all there, we just need to learn how to use it.",
ticketsage custom solutions,TICKETsage has gotten it right!,Willis A.,Executive Director,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Aug 07, 2009",4,4,nan,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: Ease of use, flexibility, addons, customer service. This system is going to save us a lot of money through ease of use and reduced labor costs. If you have a subscriber base, data rollover, speed of processing, and package sales capability are very strong and useful features.",Cons: What few problems we had because of our special needs were taken care of in a prompt and courteous manner. Training could be improved with a manual and more personalized training to eliminate user error. In a few cases we found ourselves not understanding parts of the software. TICKETsage has been proactive in solving problems and helping us.,"Overall: After years of Ticketmaster, Tickets.com, New Era, and Showare, it is refreshing to find a ticket software that completely fits our needs. Their CEO was a breeze to work with and we settled into our deal with few complications and very little legal oversight. Our legal counsel pretty much said that everything was great with their contract and we should sign, this was a first for us. Their entire staff is to be applauded for their customer service and genuine attitude.",
ticketsage custom solutions,TICKETsage Untiy platform review,Jack N.,Operations Supervisor,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Aug 07, 2009",4,5,nan,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: Untiy has an intuitive UI, easy to use for box office staff and patrons alike. It's exceptionally reliable for a hosted platform. I can't say enough about the tech support. They're always helpful; quick to respond and to add or modify features, if that's appropriate. Back-end reporting functions make it easy to generate basic reports or to export data from more complex analysis or marketing purposes. The system maintains reliable, accurate inventories for online and box office sales. Credit card processing is extremely fast, and they made it easy for us to settle directly to our bank. They have managed to balance ease of use with flexibility, making this a good product for almost any venue.","Cons: Some parts of the back-end are a bit rusty, although these are mostly cosmetic issues. Currently, online buyers can't use existing patron records resulting in duplicate patron info for orders placed online. I'd like for patrons to have to ability to use an email/password combo to order tickets. There's a tool to merge orders under these duplicate records, but that's a step I'd rather avoid...","Overall: In my opinion, of the systems I've looked at, Ticketsage offers services, features and really great technical support at a price point that can't be beat. We ticket about 30 events per year - 12,000 to 15,000 tickets per year - and Ticketsage performs pretty close to flawlessly.",
ticketsage custom solutions,Flexible and User Friendly,Kate R.,Box Office Manager,,,nan,Source: Capterra,"Aug 06, 2009",4,5,nan,5,nan,nan,,"Pros: We have found Ticketsage to be incredibly user friendly. The ease of training new staff on this system makes it so valuable for our organization. Additionally, Curious Theatre Company has recently gone through significant changes in seating, all of which Ticketsage has accomodated with flexibility.","Cons: We've found that Ticketsage is not particularly compatible with Mac systems, which poses a problem for our organization.","Overall: Ticketsage is the strongest of the midsize ticketing systems that I have experienced, particularly because of their very responsive technical team.",

Integrating development and ticket purchase information has never been easier for us.

Steven and Sandy have been the best at understanding our business and working with us to achieve our goals.","Cons: Could use more people in Tech Support however Justine, Josh and Jessica are amazing.","Overall: The more you know about your specific needs the better Ticketsage is able to help you.

A wonderful ticketing tool.",
